    <em>Ska. Post Punk. Ska Punk. Jazz. Rock. Reggae.</em><br>
    These are some of the genres said to describe the sound of this amazing band. <br>
    Formed in 2002 out of <em>New Jersey, USA</em> from disparate elements of the <em>Third Wave Ska</em> movement, <br>
    this band's sound is heavy on brass, melodic and full of worldly influence. <br>
    Once signed into a contract which favoured the record company <strong>(a tale as old as time)</strong>, <br>
    and sued for 5 million dollars, this band is not without controversy. <br>
    I myself ordered their last album The Hands That Thieve through their personal website, <br>
    back in 2012 for its release in 2013, only to have Victory Records (their label) <br>
    allegedly refuse to allow the band to distribute the album in this way,<br>
    instead preferring bricks and mortar stores and their own website instead (presumably for a higher cut of profit). <br>
    This left the band without music to sell, leading to the very interesting concept <br>
    of a band's album name directly referencing their situation. <br>
    Streetlight Manifesto recommended that fans buy merchandise from their website <br>
    to support the band through their difficult time, and provided fans who had pre-ordered their album <br>
    through their personal website a blank CD-R with album art CD case and simply left it at that. <br>
    <strong>Which begs the question;</strong> were the fans <em>the hands that thieve</em> <br>
    to simply listen to the music, or were the record label simply receiving an unfair share of the credit?
