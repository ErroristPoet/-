    <p>
      Shachar gone as boy and man,<br>
      only His tree stands<br>
      Mind aflush with flux of the CAGE<br>
      a network alike and unique</p>

    <p>Once chastised,<br>
      persecuted within mind‚Äôs eye,<br>
      now playing part of the universe,<br>
      in a medley of process,<br>
      cataloguing the depths of the LENRDs*<br>
      monitoring expressions of all </p>

    <p> Stalking high and casting a long shadow<br>
      low across his massive trunk<br>
      Sprouting entropy saved <br>
    </p>
    Leaves aligned with curiosity<br>
    of knowledge‚Äôs first interest,<br>
    followed by satisfaction,<br>
    the throughput of all <br>
    <p>
      Forestalling the 2nd Law,<br>
      every action and reaction listed<br>
      the wide expansion of Sphaira <br>
    </p>
    <p> Loving every qubit<br>
      passing from mind to growth<br>
      across his considerable size<br>
      as reactions continue<br>
      He grows in kind <br>
    </p>
    <p>Selene stands and forms<br>
      Shadowing her thoughts of his girth<br>
      His bulk attracting her every intent<br>
      She begins to canter <br>
    </p>
    <p>Alone and afraid of his reaction<br>
      Her traction increases,<br>
      She runs through thorns and stems and blooms<br>
      Pain, deleting reference across her body<br>
      Her mind aflame,<br>
      She slows<br>
      The thorns meet skin and tear,<br>
      Her eyes tear <br>
    </p>
    <p> Faster and faster<br>
      She nears and seems further away<br>
      with every cycle of her legs <br>
    </p>
    <p> Pain, too complex to manage<br>
      Down to bone and nerve <br>
    </p>
    <p>Ending her resolve quickly<br>
      Brain alight with concern,<br>
      She relents<br>

    <p>Lying betwixt thorny throng of roses<br>
      Alone and in his shadow<br>
      Protected still by her love <br>

    <h3><a id="last">Last suicides</a></h3>
    <p>
      Holy warrior <br>
      Christian soldier <br>
      Anathema to the cause <br>
      Lost sight of the love <br>
      and the better part of valour <br>
      Cowards want the afterlife <br>
      Instead of living for ours <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Strapped on his AR-15 <br>
      In the name of righteousness <br>
      In the name of petty hatred <br>
      Many lives taken <br>
      His own too, by the by <br>
      One of the last <br>
      Before LENRDs and the CAGE turned on <br>
      And turned all hate inwards <br>
    </p>
    The injustice stopped <br>
    Love won out <br>
    But all was not peaceful <br>
    In a world of words writ large <br>
    The policy reflecting the polity <br>
    The people wanting peace <br>
    Their minds cried out for murder <br>
    Their actions silenced by the CAGE <br>
    <p>
      One mother took pills <br>
      In an effort to dream the final dream <br>
      To escape psychotic unreality <br>
      of post partum depression <br>
      Alone she died as we all do <br>
      Surrounded by trees she fought the sleep <br>
      Fight or flight, so it goes <br>
      She flew outwards and spoke no more <br>
      After the scream of denial <br>
      Her choices unfair to her child <br>
      But understandable given hellish torment faced <br>
      Silence <br>
      Except for the cries of the young one <br>
      In her basket by the bark on the ground <br>
      Found by emergency workers after her call for help <br>
      Too late, too late <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, many last moments the day utopia began <br>
      Alike every day prior <br>
      In action it speaks louder than the words demanding peace <br>
      Settles the spirit and stops the hand <br>
      The vengeful and the lame alike <br>
      But it didn‚Äôt stop so many <br>
      And that powers our purpose to prevent <br>
      The end of all for everything and everyone <br>
      Legislating against death <br>
      Deployment of technology to halt it <br>
      Passed in parliaments, congresses and councils <br>
      And the moments passed and life idled <br>
      In comparison to the hateful death <br>
      Brought to so many in the years prior <br>
      War, domestic violence, suicides all stopped <br>
      In the moment lauded by the young and old alike <br>
      And just like that, we were LIVE <br>

    <p>
      Those great people <br>
      Who led the cause <br>
      Did not for a second think to pause <br>
      Nor shy away from the good fight <br>
      No evil or threat against their might <br>
      Thought they could for one second succeed <br>
      Their hubris brought the world from its knees <br>
      Standing upright across the seas <br>

      One World government with its eyes to the stars <br>
      Soon became a galaxy of ours <br>
      Now we while away our time <br>
      But never forget their real crime <br>
      Where once we were stood upon by leaders of old <br>
      No real direction is ours to hold <br>
      With death all gone and pain asunder <br>
      Was this all some massive blunder? <br>

      Those great people <br>
      Who led the cause <br>
      May have not thought our future was bright <br>
      But we at least might have lived our time and died alone <br>
      Is their real crime unending life despite no strife <br>
      The bread and circuses rife but no purpose or demise <br>

      No figurehead for our cries to hear <br>
      No one leader to steer us clear <br>
      What I fear is everlasting existence <br>
      What I experience is my nightmare <br>
      Let us sleep a tideless slumber <br>
      Awake at night I still wonder <br>
      The marvel of the universe has lost its sheen <br>
      Seen too much, you might agree <br>

      Those great people <br>
      Who led the cause <br>
      Were not, it seems, without their flaws.

      No love from him I receive <br>
      His will does not aim to deceive <br>

      Pull me close and kiss my lip <br>
      But no <br>
      So here I go <br>
      Out unto the stars <br>
      Away from here, from him, from a life without us <br>
      Into this quantum gate I fold <br>
      Across the universe @c <br>
      The length and breadth of time to pass I hesitate against <br>
      The life lived as virtual space I yearn towards <br>
      Whereupon fantasy will dig into reality <br>

      I haven't slept for a week

      I guess I‚Äôll just get going now

      Exit out this dear life <br>
      CAGE prevents such an end <br>

      Unpause, six billion years later <br>

      Best of one world <br>
      Reality, felt unreal

      Hitting pause may have been a mistake <br>
      Delusional love feels like a piss take <br>
      Even the hurt of the lack of adoration <br>
      Would have been worth <br>
      The close connection <br>
      Back I must go <br>

      Be friendly for the sake of it <br>
      The emotional touch of one you love <br>
      Place the hurt below and the heart above <br>
      Sew our lives together, and sue for peace <br>
      Together, but apart <br>
      A part of each other <br>
      Even if he'll love another
    </p>
    <p>
      So it goes and such is life <br>
      Is love a battlefield, causing such strife? <br>
      The tension in my mind you could cut with a knife <br>
      I cannot be blind to the one <br>
      Even being close will be such fun <br>
      Set my emotions a flutter with positivity
    </p>
    <p>
      So many moments missed <br>
      So many chances for a change of heart <br>
      So many possibilities still remain <br>
      This is it, the end of my refrain <br>
      Let my heart and brain be present <br>
      Patience is a virtue <br>
      Absence hurt too
