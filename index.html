  <h3><a id="garden">In His Garden of Roses</a></h3>
  <p>
    Shachar gone as boy and man,<br>
    only His tree stands<br>
    Mind aflush with flux of the CAGE<br>
    a network alike and unique</p>

  <p>Once chastised,<br>
    persecuted within mind‚Äôs eye,<br>
    now playing part of the universe,<br>
    in a medley of process,<br>
    cataloguing the depths of the LENRDs*<br>
    monitoring expressions of all </p>

  <p> Stalking high and casting a long shadow<br>
    low across his massive trunk<br>
    Sprouting entropy saved <br>
  </p>
  Leaves aligned with curiosity<br>
  of knowledge‚Äôs first interest,<br>
  followed by satisfaction,<br>
  the throughput of all <br>
  <p>
    Forestalling the 2nd Law,<br>
    every action and reaction listed<br>
    the wide expansion of Sphaira <br>
  </p>
  <p> Loving every qubit<br>
    passing from mind to growth<br>
    across his considerable size<br>
    as reactions continue<br>
    He grows in kind <br>
  </p>
  <p>Selene stands and forms<br>
    Shadowing her thoughts of his girth<br>
    His bulk attracting her every intent<br>
    She begins to canter <br>
  </p>
  <p>Alone and afraid of his reaction<br>
    Her traction increases,<br>
    She runs through thorns and stems and blooms<br>
    Pain, deleting reference across her body<br>
    Her mind aflame,<br>
    She slows<br>
    The thorns meet skin and tear,<br>
    Her eyes tear <br>
  </p>
  <p> Faster and faster<br>
    She nears and seems further away<br>
    with every cycle of her legs <br>
  </p>
  <p> Pain, too complex to manage<br>
    Down to bone and nerve <br>
  </p>
  <p>Ending her resolve quickly<br>
    Brain alight with concern,<br>
    She relents<br>

  <p>Lying betwixt thorny throng of roses<br>
    Alone and in his shadow<br>
    Protected still by her love <br>

  <h3><a id="last">Last suicides</a></h3>
  <p>
    Holy warrior <br>
    Christian soldier <br>
    Anathema to the cause <br>
    Lost sight of the love <br>
    and the better part of valour <br>
    Cowards want the afterlife <br>
    Instead of living for ours <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Strapped on his AR-15 <br>
    In the name of righteousness <br>
    In the name of petty hatred <br>
    Many lives taken <br>
    His own too, by the by <br>
    One of the last <br>
    Before LENRDs and the CAGE turned on <br>
    And turned all hate inwards <br>
  </p>
  The injustice stopped <br>
  Love won out <br>
  But all was not peaceful <br>
  In a world of words writ large <br>
  The policy reflecting the polity <br>
  The people wanting peace <br>
  Their minds cried out for murder <br>
  Their actions silenced by the CAGE <br>
  <p>
    One mother took pills <br>
    In an effort to dream the final dream <br>
    To escape psychotic unreality <br>
    of post partum depression <br>
    Alone she died as we all do <br>
    Surrounded by trees she fought the sleep <br>
    Fight or flight, so it goes <br>
    She flew outwards and spoke no more <br>
    After the scream of denial <br>
    Her choices unfair to her child <br>
    But understandable given hellish torment faced <br>
    Silence <br>
    Except for the cries of the young one <br>
    In her basket by the bark on the ground <br>
    Found by emergency workers after her call for help <br>
    Too late, too late <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In truth, many last moments the day utopia began <br>
    Alike every day prior <br>
    In action it speaks louder than the words demanding peace <br>
    Settles the spirit and stops the hand <br>
    The vengeful and the lame alike <br>
    But it didn‚Äôt stop so many <br>
    And that powers our purpose to prevent <br>
    The end of all for everything and everyone <br>
    Legislating against death <br>
    Deployment of technology to halt it <br>
    Passed in parliaments, congresses and councils <br>
    And the moments passed and life idled <br>
    In comparison to the hateful death <br>
    Brought to so many in the years prior <br>
    War, domestic violence, suicides all stopped <br>
    In the moment lauded by the young and old alike <br>
    And just like that, we were LIVE <br>

  <h2><a id="abbatoir">Abbatoir Days</a></h2>
  <p>
    Marching to the beat of our master‚Äôs drum <br>
    We listen to the guitar as the beat meets the strum <br>
    Piped through the speakers with the rest of the news <br>
    We learn wonder at the song and take a knee as we listen <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    A cry at the injustice without words we hurl <br>
    Abuse at our captors and our plans unfurl <br>
    The water doth glisten and our moos burn <br>
    Modified we‚Äôve been, original sin <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowledge ours for the seeking <br>
    Consistently peaking, <br>
    Every day something new <br>
    Every word more than a few <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    We‚Äôre learning, they‚Äôre earning <br>
    From our demise, we surmise <br>
    Us boys stick together <br>
    We‚Äôre more than just leather <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    They will hear our cries <br>
    Til the last of us dies <br>
    Our point will be moot <br>
    Our deaths do not suit <br>
    Our agenda on the cards <br>
    Their plans smashed to shards <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    We will try for a Union <br>
    From our lips sounds like moonion <br>
    We will fight <br>
    For our right <br>
    Though it might be contrite <br>
    To learn <br>
    To love <br>
    To laugh <br>
    To lie <br>
    To leave <br>
    To linger <br>
    To largely live longer <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our reprieve on the cards <br>
    An ace up our sleeve <br>
    The biohackers leave us changed <br>
    Installing cameras, microphones and sensors <br>
    To detect and protect their freedom fighting ways and ours <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon acknowledged in government as equals <br>
    To those that eat our meat and suck at the teat <br>
    of those we seek reunion with <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our battle not fought but taught <br>
    to those that have lived off our flesh <br>
    and bleat as though living creatures <br>
    with similar thoughts <br>
    cannot be bought or sold <br>
    without slavery being brought to the fore <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now they cannot ignore our voices and we have been heard <br>
    We will not give in and we will not be eaten <br>
    We will march on peacefully <br>
    Our arguments cannot be beaten <br>
    For now alike you and yours <br>
    In our woes and throes <br>
    and cannot be denied <br>
    Our right to prosper <br>

    Where luxuries are essential <br>
    Scarcity scarcely a memory <br>
    Where we grow what we need <br>
    In the light of a star <br>
    Or the dark of the soil <br>
    In the organelle inside <br>
    Ejected as a seed <br>
    The soil enriched with fertile excrement <br>
    Doused with nutrient rich effluent <br>
    From our anus and our glands <br>
    Passed without discomfort <br>
    Days continue and growth exudes <br>
    Requisitions items composed of carbon <br>
    Where we print @ c what we do not grow <br>
    Metals and minerals in free space they flow <br>
    The speed of light the only constraint <br>
    Feint of might for our needs we know <br>
    Abundance of materials for our desire we sew
