    <h3><a id="garden">In His Garden of Roses</a></h3>
    <p>
      Shachar gone as boy and man,<br>
      only His tree stands<br>
      Mind aflush with flux of the CAGE<br>
      a network alike and unique</p>

    <p>Once chastised,<br>
      persecuted within mind‚Äôs eye,<br>
      now playing part of the universe,<br>
      in a medley of process,<br>
      cataloguing the depths of the LENRDs*<br>
      monitoring expressions of all </p>

    <p> Stalking high and casting a long shadow<br>
      low across his massive trunk<br>
      Sprouting entropy saved <br>
    </p>
    Leaves aligned with curiosity<br>
    of knowledge‚Äôs first interest,<br>
    followed by satisfaction,<br>
    the throughput of all <br>
    <p>
      Forestalling the 2nd Law,<br>
      every action and reaction listed<br>
      the wide expansion of Sphaira <br>
    </p>
    <p> Loving every qubit<br>
      passing from mind to growth<br>
      across his considerable size<br>
      as reactions continue<br>
      He grows in kind <br>
    </p>
    <p>Selene stands and forms<br>
      Shadowing her thoughts of his girth<br>
      His bulk attracting her every intent<br>
      She begins to canter <br>
    </p>
    <p>Alone and afraid of his reaction<br>
      Her traction increases,<br>
      She runs through thorns and stems and blooms<br>
      Pain, deleting reference across her body<br>
      Her mind aflame,<br>
      She slows<br>
      The thorns meet skin and tear,<br>
      Her eyes tear <br>
    </p>
    <p> Faster and faster<br>
      She nears and seems further away<br>
      with every cycle of her legs <br>
    </p>
    <p> Pain, too complex to manage<br>
      Down to bone and nerve <br>
    </p>
    <p>Ending her resolve quickly<br>
      Brain alight with concern,<br>
      She relents<br>

      <p>Lying betwixt thorny throng of roses<br>
        Alone and in his shadow<br>
        Protected still by her love <br>
      </p>

      <h3><a id="last">Last suicides</a></h3>
      <p>
        Holy warrior <br>
        Christian soldier <br>
        Anathema to the cause <br>
        Lost sight of the love <br>
        and the better part of valour <br>
        Cowards want the afterlife <br>
        Instead of living for ours <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Strapped on his AR-15 <br>
        In the name of righteousness <br>
        In the name of petty hatred <br>
        Many lives taken <br>
        His own too, by the by <br>
        One of the last <br>
        Before LENRDs and the CAGE turned on <br>
        And turned all hate inwards <br>
      </p>
      The injustice stopped <br>
      Love won out <br>
      But all was not peaceful <br>
      In a world of words writ large <br>
      The policy reflecting the polity <br>
      The people wanting peace <br>
      Their minds cried out for murder <br>
      Their actions silenced by the CAGE <br>
      <p>
        One mother took pills <br>
        In an effort to dream the final dream <br>
        To escape psychotic unreality <br>
        of post partum depression <br>
        Alone she died as we all do <br>
        Surrounded by trees she fought the sleep <br>
        Fight or flight, so it goes <br>
        She flew outwards and spoke no more <br>
        After the scream of denial <br>
        Her choices unfair to her child <br>
        But understandable given hellish torment faced <br>
        Silence <br>
        Except for the cries of the young one <br>
        In her basket by the bark on the ground <br>
        Found by emergency workers after her call for help <br>
        Too late, too late <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth, many last moments the day utopia began <br>
        Alike every day prior <br>
        In action it speaks louder than the words demanding peace <br>
        Settles the spirit and stops the hand <br>
        The vengeful and the lame alike <br>
        But it didn‚Äôt stop so many <br>
        And that powers our purpose to prevent <br>
        The end of all for everything and everyone <br>
        Legislating against death <br>
        Deployment of technology to halt it <br>
        Passed in parliaments, congresses and councils <br>
        And the moments passed and life idled <br>
        In comparison to the hateful death <br>
        Brought to so many in the years prior <br>
        War, domestic violence, suicides all stopped <br>
        In the moment lauded by the young and old alike <br>
        And just like that, we were LIVE <br>

        Piped through the speakers with the rest of the news <br>
        We learn wonder at the song and take a knee as we listen <br>
      </p>

        A cry at the injustice without words we hurl <br>
        Abuse at our captors and our plans unfurl <br>

        We will try for a Union <br>
        From our lips sounds like moonion <br>

        Who said‚Äî‚Äúone vast trunk and legs of carbon <br>
        Stand in the garden. . . . Near them, in the rose bushes, <br>
        Half sunk a shattered HI lies, whose frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold demand, <br>
        Tell that its creator well those passions read <br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these living things, <br>
        The heart that mocked them, and the brain that led; <br>
        And atop the canopy, these words appear bright in the light of the sky above, <br>
        My name is Shachar, founder of Sphaira: <br>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and rejoice! <br>
        Everything abound remains. Round the growth <br>
        Of that colossal culture, boundless and full <br>
        The LIVE and level minds stretch far away.‚Äù

      <p>
        Those great people <br>
        Who led the cause <br>
        Did not for a second think to pause <br>
        Nor shy away from the good fight <br>
        No evil or threat against their might <br>
        Thought they could for one second succeed <br>
        Their hubris brought the world from its knees <br>
        Standing upright across the seas <br>

        One World government with its eyes to the stars <br>
        Soon became a galaxy of ours <br>
        Now we while away our time <br>
        But never forget their real crime <br>
        Where once we were stood upon by leaders of old <br>
        No real direction is ours to hold <br>
        With death all gone and pain asunder <br>
        Was this all some massive blunder? <br>

        Those great people <br>
        Who led the cause <br>
        May have not thought our future was bright <br>
        But we at least might have lived our time and died alone <br>
        Is their real crime unending life despite no strife <br>
        The bread and circuses rife but no purpose or demise <br>

        No figurehead for our cries to hear <br>
        No one leader to steer us clear <br>
        What I fear is everlasting existence <br>
        What I experience is my nightmare <br>
        Let us sleep a tideless slumber <br>
        Awake at night I still wonder <br>
        The marvel of the universe has lost its sheen <br>
        Seen too much, you might agree <br>

        Those great people <br>
        Who led the cause <br>
        Were not, it seems, without their flaws.

        Sew our lives together, and sue for peace <br>

        Low-Energy Neutron Radiation Detectors <br>
        Or LENRDs for short <br>
        Were not designed by biological minds <br>
        Nor built by biological hands <br>
        Parsed instead by a Quantum AI <br>
        The culmination of Quantum Supremacy <br>
        Which heretofore promised such elegance <br>
        Delivered in kind, to reactions of glory/horror <br>
        Where everything is known, everything true <br>
        Where lies and falsehoods discounted <br>
        In favour of objective reality measured <br>
        Akin to the Bonner spheres of old <br>
        Detecting high-energy neutrons <br>
        Such as from distant stars <br>
        Focussing instead on the itty-bitty expressions <br>
        A scintillating concept was born
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the question of the QAI asked <br>
        The answer given to all <br>
        That did or could or would conceivably occur <br>
        Drowning out opinion and traditional modelling <br>
        A bouquet of LENRDs activated <br>
        The moments known in full <br>
        What transpired known to the QAI <br>
        Via complex algorithm <br>
        Identifying vast legions of neutrons <br>
        Truly their very uniquity in ubiquity <br>
        To know what was said, thought, actioned <br>
        Or just yet-to-be, set in motion through inertia <br>
        A devastating blow to the unknown <br>
        Where once were questions, now, knowledge

        On the cusp of immortality <br>
        The religious and craven left standing <br>
        Beckoned death and a 'natural order' <br>
        For life everlasting with their God <br>
        Be it in Heaven or Hell, not Earth nor the stars <br>
        Death seen to be more appealing <br>

        Across all of Sphaira's sphere of influence <br>
        Occurred in a concerted fashion <br>
        Devastating a united world <br>
        1367 dead, by their own hand <br>
        525,661 dead by the hand of ignorance <br>
        In the name of righteousness <br>
        Until all were tired of their bleating <br>
        And their violence, and their murder <br>
        The CAGE brought change on March 15th 2085 <br>
        The Ides marked, an archaic calendar <br>
        Soon to be replaced by one, universal <br>
        The debt death hath taken, settled finally <br>
        No foul deed could occur onwards <br>
        No assault, rape nor death <br>

        Overwhelming power, miniscule subtlety <br>
        Contraception for all life's ills <br>
