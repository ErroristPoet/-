      <h3><a href="blog2.html">Learning to Ice Skate</a></h3>
      <strong>November 4th, 2021</strong>
      <div class="blog-post">
        <p>Recently, possibly due to having ADHD, I've picked up a new, expensive hobby. <br>
          Much to the delight of my lovely wife. <br>
          It happens to be something I'm currently quite passionate about, as it goes with ADHD. <br>
          However, I'm equal parts terrified and exhilerated by it. <br>
          Prior to last Saturday, I had been to an Ice Rink twice in my life. <br>
          But with a bit of luck, a chunk of change and an interest that is bordering on unhealthy, <br>
          I signed up for Ice Skating lessons before even setting skate to ice for the third time. <br>
          Since then, I've become a tad more confident after my first lesson. <br>
          You could say I'm skating on thin ice, but as you'll see below, I prefer to think: <br>
          "Slow and steady wins no race, but it keeps the ice from off ya face." <br></p>
