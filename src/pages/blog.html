    <p>Theodore (or simply Teddy), is one handsome cat. He's slight in weight and equal parts energy and affection. As a burmese, he has strikingly attractive features and beautiful blue-green eyes and I often find myself taken aback in the proper lighting. However, due to the aforementioned energy, he is one tough cookie to photograph. Movement and a seeming awareness of the camera ruin what could have been a good photo. Alas, I have taken a few in my time, for example:<img class="teddy-eye" src="https://paulfdonnelly.com/teddy-eye.jpg" alt="Teddy's Eye"> <caption>Teddy's Eye</caption>
