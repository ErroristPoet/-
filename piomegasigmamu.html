    March, 2020 - <br>In His Garden of Roses <br>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Shachar gone as boy and man,<br>
        only His tree stands<br>
        Mind aflush with flux of the CAGE*<br>
        a network alike and unique</p>

      <p>Once chastised,<br>
        persecuted within mind‚Äôs eye,<br>
        now playing part of the universe,<br>
        in a medley of process,<br>
        cataloguing the depths of the NRDs**<br>
        monitoring expressions of all </p>

      <p> Stalking high and casting a long shadow<br>
        low across his massive trunk<br>
        Sprouting entropy saved <br>
      </p>
      Leaves aligned with curiosity<br>
      of knowledge‚Äôs first interest,<br>
      followed by satisfaction,<br>
      the throughput of all <br>
      <p>
        Forestalling the 2nd Law,<br>
        every action and reaction listed<br>
        the wide expansion of Sphaira <br>
      </p>
      <p> Loving every qubit<br>
        passing from mind to growth<br>
        across his considerable size<br>
        as reactions continue<br>
        He grows in kind <br>
      </p>
      <p>Selene stands and forms<br>
        Shadowing her thoughts of his girth<br>
        His bulk attracting her every intent<br>
        She begins to canter <br>
      </p>
      <p>Alone and afraid of his reaction<br>
        Her traction increases,<br>
        She runs through thorns and stems and blooms<br>
        Pain, deleting reference across her body<br>
        Her mind aflame,<br>
        She slows<br>
        The thorns meet skin and tear,<br>
        Her eyes tear <br>
      </p>
      <p> Faster and faster<br>
        She nears and seems further away<br>
        with every cycle of her legs <br>
      </p>
      <p> Pain, too complex to manage<br>
        Down to bone and nerve <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ending her resolve quickly<br>
        Brain alight with concern,<br>
        She relents<br>

      <p>Lying betwixt thorny throng of roses<br>
        Alone and in his shadow<br>
        Protected still by her love <br>

     March, 2020 - <br>Last suicides       <br>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Holy warrior <br>
        Christian soldier <br>
        Anathema to the cause <br>
        Lost sight of the love <br>
        and the better part of valour <br>
        Cowards want the afterlife <br>
        Instead of living for ours <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Strapped on his AR-15 <br>
        In the name of righteousness <br>
        In the name of petty hatred <br>
        Many lives taken <br>
        His own too, by the by <br>
        One of the last <br>
        Before NRDs and the CAGE turned on <br>
        And turned all hate inwards <br>
      </p>
      The injustice stopped <br>
      Love won out <br>
      But all was not peaceful <br>
      In a world of words writ large <br>
      The policy reflecting the polity <br>
      The people wanting peace <br>
      Their minds cried out for murder <br>
      Their actions silenced by the CAGE <br>
      <p>
        One mother took pills <br>
        In an effort to dream the final dream <br>
        To escape psychotic unreality <br>
        of post partum depression <br>
        Alone she died as we all do <br>
        Surrounded by trees she fought the sleep <br>
        Fight or flight, so it goes <br>
        She flew outwards and spoke no more <br>
        After the scream of denial <br>
        Her choices unfair to her child <br>
        But understandable given hellish torment faced <br>
        Silence <br>
        Except for the cries of the young one <br>
        In her basket by the bark on the ground <br>
        Found by emergency workers after her call for help <br>
        Too late, too late <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        In truth, many last moments the day utopia began <br>
        Alike every day prior <br>
        In action it speaks louder than the words demanding peace <br>
        Settles the spirit and stops the hand <br>
        The vengeful and the lame alike <br>
        But it didn‚Äôt stop so many <br>
        And that powers our purpose to prevent <br>
        The end of all for everything and everyone <br>
        Legislating against death <br>
        Deployment of technology to halt it <br>
        Passed in parliaments, congresses and councils <br>
        And the moments passed and life idled <br>
        In comparison to the hateful death <br>
        Brought to so many in the years prior <br>
        War, domestic violence, suicides all stopped <br>
        In the moment lauded by the young and old alike <br>
        And just like that, we were LIVE <br>

        We listen to the guitar as the beat meets the strum <br>
        Piped through the speakers with the rest of the news <br>
        We learn wonder at the song and take a knee as we listen <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        A cry at the injustice without words we hurl <br>
        Abuse at our captors and our plans unfurl <br>

        Now they cannot ignore our voices and we have been heard <br>
        We will not give in and we will not be eaten <br>
        We will march on peacefully <br>
        Our arguments cannot be beaten <br>
        For now alike you and yours <br>

        Is their real crime unending life despite no strife <br>
        The bread and circuses rife but no purpose or demise <br>

        No figurehead for our cries to hear <br>
        No one leader to steer us clear <br>
        What I fear is everlasting existence <br>
        What I experience is my nightmare <br>
        Let us sleep a tideless slumber <br>
        Awake at night I still wonder <br>
        The marvel of the universe has lost its sheen <br>
        Seen too much, you might agree <br>

        Those great people <br>
        Who led the cause <br>
        Were not, it seems, without their flaws.

        No requirement for my slumber, <br>
        But the feeling's nice <br>
        Feel my emotions turn to ice

        Would have been worth <br>
        The close connection <br>
        Back I must go <br>
        Seek him out
      </p>
      <p>
        Be friendly for the sake of it <br>
        The emotional touch of one you love <br>
        Place the hurt below and the heart above <br>
        Sew our lives together, and sue for peace <br>
        Together, but apart <br>
        A part of each other <br>
        Even if he'll love another

        So it goes and such is life <br>

        So many moments missed <br>
        So many chances for a change of heart <br>
        So many possibilities still remain <br>
        This is it, the end of my refrain <br>
        Let my heart and brain be present <br>

        Absence hurt too

        The Ides marked, an archaic calendar <br>
        Soon to be replaced by one, universal <br>
        The debt death hath taken, settled finally <br>
        No foul deed could occur onwards <br>
        No assault, rape nor death <br>
        Tragedy ameliorated at once <br>
        Electromagnetism at play <br>
        Overwhelming power, miniscule subtlety <br>
        Contraception for all life's ills <br>
        A wonder for the modern world

        State your business, <br>
        purrs the cat against such a beckoning. <br>
        It is the hour, <br>
        boomed the vibrations low and waveforms high <br>
        from the creature alight and in their sight. <br>
        <br>
        And as the sky and reality parted, <br>
        the creatures of night took a stand <br>
        Against death and the thought of a passing <br>
        Against the white light occurring outwards <br>
        Surrounding moments and truths <br>
        and the lies and the CAGE <br>
        <br>
        The End is Nigh <br>
        <br>
        And as pews raise across the ground <br>
        A rabbit, a hare and a pig and a hound <br>
        A cat and 3 birds of a black feather bound <br>
        Away from the nothing the creature is offering <br>
        For the precipice of the space growing <br>
        Between the light outside of all space <br>
        And the LIVE growing inside reality <br>

        The End is Nigh <br>

        An unknown to the NRDs <br>
        a mystery described by the cat <br>
        as a thought springing to mind <br>
        a niggling creeping, ugly feeling <br>
        of nothing and no reaction <br>
        And she hissed. <br>
        <br>
        As the white light dimmed <br>
        And its nothing folded back in <br>
        On the something found here <br>
        And flames became soot spewing forth <br>
        From its mass, from its eyes and all holes <br>
        Came a look of knowledge <br>
        Passed to the cat <br>
        And as she turned and purred happily <br>
        She stretched and sat inside a box <br>
        Certain as to its future <br>
        As the night grew in the still moments passing <br>
        <br>
        The cat slumbers, and stares inwards <br>
        The Secret Emperor of the Universe asleep <br>
        And reality holds a deeper message <br>
        in the minds of all those LIVE <br>
        of life and the origins of the first question <br>
        "Why?" <br>
        In a true instinctual reaction <br>

        Those who see fit to question this undertaking <br>
        and our resolve, is lamented as ignorance. <br>
        Today we halted velocity of ‚ÄúŒ©‚Äù and applied force,<br>

        <br>
        The now asymmetrically affected asteroid designated ‚ÄúŒ©‚Äù <br>
        will be combined with local Moons such as Phobos and Deimos <br>
        and will be forced into a maintainable orbital velocity around Mars. <br>
        Life will become simultaneously possible by exerting ourselves in such <br>
        a massive engineering feat, the likes of which is unprecedented, <br>
        and planting whole cultures of biological matter via efficient genomic engineering. <br>
        <br>

        in increasing capacity, to be continued on ŒñŒ©Œó by our touching tips of <br>

        consciousness deemed final, and still yet <br>
        no evidence of a deity or afterlife though <br>
        such a search was intensive and extensive ‚Äòlo <br>
        these past 14 billion years. <br>
        <br>
        A yawn a stretch, eyes agape and all four paws atop firm ground, <br>
        slow bounce to canter, a destination in mind. <br>
        A hard ask, the cat thought, echoing the will of the many: <br>
        to allow an end to what logic dictated long ago and ever since: <br>
        Life itself is an objective good, <br>
        in place, a system designed to deny subjective evil, <br>
        via checks and balances; <br>
        NRDs detecting truth of all, <br>
        CAGE protecting all to see. <br>
        <br>
        The cat stops suddenly mid-stride. <br>
        Drops to one side, and closes both eyes. <br>
        A yawn, a stretch and a decision delayed. <br>
        The Secret Emperor Of The Universe sleeps.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        by Victoria Frankenstein <br>
        <br>
        A- or an-, from Greek, to be without <br>
        <br>
        Agnostic, without proof <br>
        Anaerobic, without oxygen <br>
        Anaesthesia, without sensation <br>
        Anarchic, without respect for order <br>
        Anaemia, without enough erythrocytes <br>
        Anhedonia, action without pleasure <br>
        Apathetic, without emotion <br>
        Asexual, without sexual feeling <br>
        Asymmetry, without corresponding symmetry or exactness <br>
        Asynchronous, without existence or occurrence at the same time <br>
        Asystolic, without heart beat <br>
        Atheism, without belief in deities <br>
        <br>
        I posit, therefore, that we are indeed: Alive <br>
        Yes, yes, from Old English the word alive derives <br>
        However, with such meaningful reflection <br>
        We are without that which lasts forever; <br>
        being alive can easily end <br>
        We are alive in that we are without life everlasting <br>
        We are LIVE only when we cannot die <br>
        This dichotomy may indeed change, <br>
        and we may one day be LIVE.

        <br>
        With education, employment and entertainment entwined <br>
        within our mind's open-eyed sights <br>
        for such seeming flights of fancy, <br>
        these equitable senses our universal right; <br>
        enshrined protections for engagement <br>
        and privacy of ethical action -- <br>
        our meat, both brawn and brain: <br>
        thoroughly modified within ethical constraint <br>
        with our explicit consent. <br>
        <br>
        Our analogue prime <br>
        may have all hands at full capacity, <br>
        whilst inside our massive mindspan <br>
        we engage with alacrity, <br>
        diversifying culture. <br>
        <br>
        Now our minds are split serenely, <br>
        we rejoice internally, <br>
        whilst we elevate the external.

     10th May, 2023<br>Contemplating the end of all things
       
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        by Victoria Frankenstein <br>
        <br>
        It's already May, 2023 <br>
        It bothers me, for time spent I cannot see <br>
        The present so quickly can betray, we're constrained and never free <br>
        From our perception we obey - past, present and future; three <br>
        Our reactions of relief, ambivalence and dismay to-the-now, to-the-then, to-the-to-be <br>
        I reflect on possibility and inveigh poetry <br>
        But all things, be they good or bad, are said to end; this disturbs me <br>
        The natural order of predator-versus-prey, be it us-against-them or time-against-we <br>
        Even still, death-versus-life, I must object and say, from what I foresee <br>
        All things end... and for death itself... the bell will toll for thee.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The sheer amount of near-nothing we shed <br>
        Across the stars, receipts of time/space of us, discarded overhead <br>
        Of at least a Googleplex per second in resolution <br>
        The fundamental expression of our very constitution <br>
        All thoughts or dreams pouring from each head <br>
        And even though some time past now, we may all be dead <br>
        Our very once being, a legacy forever in distribution <br>
        The capture of these discharged moments a solution <br>
        To reignite the possible future for us all instead; <br>
        As if we are tied forever through space, a long unbroken golden thread.

      a momentary lapse of judgment <br>

      our appetite for conflict. <br>
      <br>
      greater still, by every order of magnitude <br>
      of the logarithmic scale, <br>
      conflict appeared to be an excession <br>

      now alike twinkling lights in the night sky <br>
      dotted across the universe in clumps <br>
      exponents of expansion of the forever peace <br>
      <br>
      for we turned our inward palm, <br>
      two fingers up and out <br>
      against logic, with great emotion <br>
      -- v was for victory -- <br>
      a disturbance of peace for the temporary win <br>
      to our outward palm <br>
      two fingers out and up <br>
      to vie √©ternit√© -- versus nothing no more -- forever <br>
      <br>
      ... and justice for just us together, <br>
      for there were no them and no 'other' <br>
      as no matter who were we, we were us -- wholly and completely. <br>
      and there were no enemies... but there was no utopia <br>
      for no matter the peace in our hearts, our minds raged onwards <br>
      as we expanded outwards

    <div class="content">
      A cacophony rains at all points <br>

      This little end of nothing, <br>

      and everything within <br>
      was now nothing at all. <br>
      <br>
      It had began <br>
      Just as suddenly as we were nothing <br>
      Remade whole, elsewhere <br>
      from our entangled states <br>
      of everything that was, <br>
      We now are again, <br>

      For nothing had been; <br>
      Everything could be nothing. <br>

      Just as easily <br>

        Cross my heart and hope to lie <br>
        About the fact we may yet die <br>
        And with great relief we heave collective sigh <br>
        For whilst there may be nothing out there on high <br>
        One day soon the old will be youthful and spry <br>
        No wrinkles or grey and no face left wry <br>
        All because we may not die <br>
        <br>
        We'll seek to be LIVE and erstwhile thrive <br>
        'neath the skies and stars above <br>
        Elsewhere from here, <br>
        Elsewhen from now, <br>
        Outwards, onwards, <br>
        On and on and on... <br>
        <br>
        Time to get a wriggle on. <br>
        Time for good to triumph over entropy <br>
        Time for Death to say goodbye <br>
        and ne'er hello, instead so lonely They cry. <br>
        <br>
        Cross my heart and speak the truth <br>
        About the fact we may not die <br>
        In-the-here and in-the-now, <br>

      <p>by Shachar Goodwyn <br>
        A unknown known <br>
        <br>
        Drifting across excessively accelerating <br>
        Drifting of near nothing, something and the things to be <br>
        Across what was Xs, what was Ys, what was Zs <br>
        And what was all the moments known heretofore as Ws <br>
        <br>
        Though we have unknowingly known <br>
        There is but yet still more unknown <br>
        As the known known known <br>
        Has already the unknown been known? <br>
        Or is yet the unknown is as yet, unknown <br>
        <br>
        In a galaxy far from here <br>
        In a when not unlike now <br>
        A short while in context ago <br>
        A Goliath faced a David <br>
        <br>
        Whereupon the slingshot was a projectile <br>
        Not shot but thought <br>
        Whereupon the fight was naught <br>
        But thinking of ideas that behoove the ability of thought <br>
        <br>
        What was the thought of this creation of naught <br>
        This literal nothing that does and could not possibly be <br>
        This subset of logic where naught should be foreseeable, possible and is <br>
        This David faced the question of naught <br>
        <br>
        Before the thought of Gods distracted us <br>
        Before the tricks of thoughts of Gods were played <br>
        We see it now as known <br>
        We wrote of it then, an unknown unknown <br>
        <br>
        How is known <br>
        Who is known <br>
        What is known <br>
        When is known <br>
        <br>
        Why is the question, <br>
        Of knowns and unknowns <br>
        Of unknowns and will bes. <br>
        Why is the question. <br>
        <br>
        Of knowing will we ever? <br>
        Of unknowing knowns, do we now? <br>
        Of now, do we know knowns? <br>

<div class="content"></div>
I think aloud to you all under occupied territories...<br>
A poor deal from representation easily interpreted as failed global prosperity - <br>
a universally misunderstood, universally maligned lack of a universal government. <br>
<br>
Too many dead, all of the time. <br>
Unused land, misused land, unparcelled freedom, <br>
profligate below exponential unsustainable growth; I think? <br>
<br>
Some view responsibility as the art of the possible. <br>
We look like children smearing hues of red across stick figure faces <br>
of varying hues and shades and colours. <br>
<br>
Technically correct scientific understanding of the thought grown into being - <br>
that much like our universe, our potential is infinite. <br>
All states, at all points, of the x, y and z <br>
Of the X1, Y1, Z1, to beyond each letter and number hitched to dimensions fundamentally in flux‚Ä¶ <br>
‚Ä¶ we need to give good respite to our discharging self governance, <br>
to caring for the other Main Characters and dispel the notion of there ever being an NPC. <br>
<br>
We must hold decent carriage of the knowledge of the flux and crux of the all-changing, <br>
ever shifting monoverse and attempt to discover, to disseminate and know the details; <br>
so the devil isn‚Äôt in them‚Ä¶ <br>
