    the dread
    Time passes too quickly
    Feel the dread
    Your life burns away
    Feel the dread
    Work takes you away from life
    Feel the dread
    Your children grow up fast
    Feel the dread
    Already left the home, and left you too
    Feel the dread
    Your skin ages and your bones ache
    Feel the dread
    Not much longer and you'll be dead
  </p>

    Death is a whore
It gets around
To all the people
Big and small
To all the people
Young and old
The day we do part
This very mortal coil
May it be kicking and screaming
Or lovingly embracing
Your very last moments
And run through your mind
The long and short of your life

Death is a whore
It deserves all your fear
Taking away all your love
It deserves all your respect
Taking away all your pain
It deserves all your ire
Taking away all your friends
It deserves all your hate
Taking away all your family
It deserves all your time
For you'll soon run out
</p>

  One long poem
From eyes first opening
From your first gasp of air
From your emptying lungs
One long poem
Open your mouth
to scream poetry
To be cradled lovingly
Welcome to the living poetry gathering
Where all thoughts, writings and spoken word
Contain nuggets of truth, falsehoods and gobbledygook
Where dreams flourish but also die
Along with you, one day
One long poem
