    <p><a id=feeldread>Feel the dread</a> <br>
      Time passes too quickly <br>
      Feel the dread <br>
      Your life burns away <br>
      Feel the dread <br>
      Work takes you away from life <br>
      Feel the dread <br>
      Your children grow up fast <br>
      Feel the dread <br>
      Already left the home, and left you too <br>
      Feel the dread <br>
      Your skin ages and your bones ache <br>
      Feel the dread <br>
      Not much longer and you'll be dead <br>

      <a id=deathwhore>Death is a whore</a> <br>
      It gets around <br>
      To all the people <br>
      Big and small <br>
      To all the people <br>
      Young and old <br>
      The day we do part <br>
      This very mortal coil <br>
      May it be kicking and screaming <br>
      Or lovingly embracing <br>
      Your very last moments <br>
      And run through your mind <br>
      The long and short of your life <br>
      Death is a whore <br>
      It deserves all your fear <br>
      Taking away all your love <br>
      It deserves all your respect <br>
      Taking away all your pain <br>
      It deserves all your ire <br>
      Taking away all your friends <br>
      It deserves all your hate <br>
      Taking away all your family <br>
      It deserves all your time <br>
      For you'll soon run out <br>

      <a id="onelong">One long poem</a> <br>
      From eyes first opening <br>
      From your first gasp of air <br>
      From your emptying lungs <br>
      One long poem <br>
      Open your mouth <br>
      to scream poetry <br>
      To be cradled lovingly <br>
      Welcome to the living poetry gathering <br>
      Where all thoughts, writings and spoken word <br>
      Contain nuggets of truth, falsehoods and gobbledygook <br>
      Where dreams flourish but also die <br>
      Along with you, one day <br>
      One long poem <br>

    Keep it sedate <br>
    Release focus on every little thing <br>
    Let the heart be your guide <br>
    As you take a break from your mind <br>
    Keep it silent <br>
    Keep it sedate <br> <br>

    <a id="deathdance">The dance with death</a>
    can be a very brief affair <br>
    or countless recitals. <br>
    With a pause between songs <br>
    as the dance doesn't end <br>
    until death takes their due. <br>
    <br>
    With no choreography, <br>
    in lockstep after pirouette <br>
    to escape your fate <br>
    and Death's hold sways. <br>
    <br>
    As Death dips you truly <br>
    a close embrace to <br>
    kiss your life away <br>
    past precipice of all <br>
    Death curtseys to the claimed <br>
    and changes partner once again. <br>

    <a id="receiptsofsuffering">Take receipts of your suffering</a>
    Add them to the piles mounting <br>
    Ever so high inside your house of Grief <br>
    Walk the stairs to reach the top <br>
    Narrowing slightly as they turn <br>
    Around and around your tower. <br>
    Take note out your windows <br>
    Of all the other spikes <br>
    Reaching to the stars <br>
    Of other people's towers, <br>
    And try not to weep, <br>
    Or become distracted, <br>
    As your receipts need piling <br>
    From the injustices you face. <br>

    <a id="worrytable">Sitting with my worries and concerns</a>
    around a table, large enough to host my anger and fear. <br>
    My happiness tells a joke in a boisterous voice as my confidence swaggers to the table. <br>
    At this my sadness, in the corner of the room, quietly whispers offence under raucous laughter. <br>
    My confidence stands, surveys the room, staggers away from the table, lightly stepping on the cat's tail, and the
    smirk is wiped quietly from my face. <br>
