    the dread <br>
    Time passes too quickly <br>
    Feel the dread <br>
    Your life burns away <br>
    Feel the dread <br>
    Work takes you away from life <br>
    Feel the dread <br>
    Your children grow up fast <br>
    Feel the dread <br>
    Already left the home, and left you too <br>
    Feel the dread <br>
    Your skin ages and your bones ache <br>
    Feel the dread <br>
    Not much longer and you'll be dead <br>

    Death is a whore <br>
    It gets around <br>
    To all the people <br>
    Big and small <br>
    To all the people <br>
    Young and old <br>
    The day we do part <br>
    This very mortal coil <br>
    May it be kicking and screaming <br>
    Or lovingly embracing <br>
    Your very last moments <br>
    And run through your mind <br>
    The long and short of your life <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Death is a whore <br>
    It deserves all your fear <br>
    Taking away all your love <br>
    It deserves all your respect <br>
    Taking away all your pain <br>
    It deserves all your ire <br>
    Taking away all your friends <br>
    It deserves all your hate <br>
    Taking away all your family <br>
    It deserves all your time <br>
    For you'll soon run out <br>

    One long poem <br>
    From eyes first opening <br>
    From your first gasp of air <br>
    From your emptying lungs <br>
    One long poem <br>
    Open your mouth <br>
    to scream poetry <br>
    To be cradled lovingly <br>
    Welcome to the living poetry gathering <br>
    Where all thoughts, writings and spoken word <br>
    Contain nuggets of truth, falsehoods and gobbledygook <br>
    Where dreams flourish but also die <br>
    Along with you, one day <br>
    One long poem <br>
