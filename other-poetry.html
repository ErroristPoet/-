        <h3>Cobble Stoned Childhood</h3>
      </a>
      I sat upright upon the cushion <br>
      Jammed betwixt panniers atop the rear wheel <br>
      Hanging on for dear comfort but also survival <br>
      His legs pumping pedals, my arms holding tight <br>
      His bulk and his jumper, thick as a tree <br>
      We rode along streets, as traffic abounded <br>
      The cacophony of lives, plain to see <br>
      Not by my small form, nor did head turn around <br>
      My face to his back was I pressed against <br>
      Not worried or fearful, was I of a fall <br>
      Trust in this man, did I place, so impressed <br>
      Of his position, still looming in my mind years hence <br>
      <br>
      Arrived at the store we did in a jiffy <br>
      Though my father did not gift me a toy <br>
      Instead simply stated at my wanting a thing <br>
      A garish yellow-green Super Soaker, <br>
      That I could save money and return later days <br>
      Though it didn't occur, he tried gifting me patience, <br>
      Knowing as I do, his intractable states, <br>
      No appeal, nor crocodile tears to manipulate <br>
      Instead I acknowledged his plan to distract <br>
      From my want, with which I would use to harass <br>
      My sister's at home and my friends unamused <br>
      Though thankful am I despite no seeming benefit <br>
      Am I for the lesson that day <br>
      The gift of his time, the ride quality <br>
      <br>
      Homeward bound do we travel, <br>
      Though my hands were not empty <br>
      Filled with knowledge and his form so plenty <br>
      A love and respect for my father, I see <br>
      Despite getting not what I desired, I did not fail to be <br>
      In awe of his stature, looming so large <br>
      At speed did we weave between cars <br>
      Homeward bound do we travel <br>
      Beneath pale blue sky, cycling smooth roads <br>
      As bike mounted curved street curb <br>
      Leading down cobble stoned alleys of old Dublin city <br>
      The memories not lost, so no use for some pity

        <h3>I am From</h3>
      </a>
      I am from the psych ward, from <br>
      Rexulti, and hallucinations all the while. <br>
      I am from the dark in winter, green grass in sallow sun. <br>
      I am from the shamrock, the stinging nettle. <br>
      I am from teetotal and social intoxication, from genetic stocks known and unknown. <br>
      I am from talktative and friendly. <br>
      From hyper and disruptive. <br>
      I am from questioning why despite no seeming answer. <br>
      To the void I shout and scream for meaning, <br>
      to the text box I fill with my own. <br>
      I am from an endless migration, <br>
      fleeing famine and seeking opportunity, <br>
      from humble potato and churned butter. <br>
      From the slap across my face, to the glasses lost below, <br>
      consigning me to blurry reality, <br>
      and the heat of angered father's at inattentive sons. <br>
      I am from the mantelpiece, <br>
      above a fire never lit, <br>
      lost items from my childhood, <br>
      I am not ashamed to admit, <br>
      once as precious as my blood, <br>
      I would likely sell for profit,
      nothing good could come from memories they would elicit, <br>
      feelings best left in the past, <br>
      that show I care not a whit, <br>
      for violent scenes and children's screams, <br>
      water flowing down my throat, <br>
      drowning slowly bit by bit, <br>
      torn away from flowing tap, <br>
      just as quickly to confess, <br>
      sorrow for my attention-deficit, <br>
      hyperactive way of being.</p>

        <h3>Illusory Will</h3>
      </a>
      Free will is an illusion
      and belief in freedom, <br>
      neither weakness nor strength; <br>
      we simply do not control our actions. <br>
      <br>
      We are the sum of our reactions <br>
      to the equal, opposite and neutral <br>
      from the Big Bang, long long ago. <br>
      <br>
      It is not free will <br>
      beckoning faith or hope or love, <br>
      but the complex ongoing reaction of the universe expressing itself.

        <h3>Evolution not Revolution</h3>
      </a>
      I am not interested in revolution.
      As the past is buried and forgotten too many times <br>
      through initial force, responsibility is displaced <br>
      by the charisma of leaders, usually ill-suited to responsibility. <br>
      <br>
      I am interested in evolution, <br>
      of form and function of processes <br>
      designed to instil progress towards <br>
      a lack of inequality and deprivation, <br>
      of sustainable growth of both technology <br>
      and provision of the basic needs <br>
      and wants of our collective population. <br>
      <br>
      We are one race, of many isles and masses, <br>
      from one small mote shielded by the bright of a single white star, <br>
      with a shared history and culture developed <br>
      by communication, travel and tragedy. <br>
      <br>
      To shed the past in form of revolution, <br>
      is to discount the lessons learned, <br>
      as whilst every action has a reaction <br>
      there is an equal, opposite and neutral reaction <br>
      to the force involved in such a plot.

      As I stared through the window, at a family not mine <br>
      From the outside looking in, though, her dress caught my eye, <br>
      Scarlet red and gleaming, alike blood spilt on snow, <br>
      Fine cutlery, now moving at rapid pace, my eye drawn to her bow, <br>
      I now watch with a fear whilst my hunger grows, <br>
      For revenge for my sister, and seeing such awful repose <br>
      A crime disappearing, whilst creating such glee <br>
      On faces speckled with flesh, my sister's innate purity <br>

      I come from a place of privilege <br>

      between ethnicities. <br>
      I stand askance on cultural barriers, <br>
      built over generations, and view <br>

      I contribute little to improve <br>
      the lot of the many, <br>

        <h3>Responsibility of all</h3>
      </a>
      I remember a night <br>
      I felt burdened by the world <br>
      and rejected the concept of sovereignty, <br>
      rejected the need for a crown of power. <br>
      <br>
      It is for all, the need to be responsible. <br>
      It is for all, the staying of the need to be powerful. <br>
      <br>
      When those who seek power, succeed and act poorly, <br>
      it is a reflection of the cognitive dissonance <br>
      surrounding the true nature of power. <br>
      <br>
      When power is wielded by those that sought it out, <br>
      it appears willy nilly and soaked in the blood of previous mistaken attempts. <br>
      <br>
      We all bear this power, without need of seeking, <br>
      as power is the responsibility of all, given to the minute few.

      from which come mythical tales of jewels from trees, <br>
      endless food and drink, <br>
      swine that regenerated daily, <br>
      and trees with silver branches, <br>
      gold and silver buildings, <br>
      immortality granted from springs, <br>
      or from fruits <br>
      or ales or wines <br>
      that heal the sick <br>
      or raise the dead. <br>
      <br>
      Tales of mythical lands <br>
      that humans oft used to seek out, <br>
      but nary find, due to mystical fog <br>
      and seas with tides either weak or strong. <br>
      <br>
      Where the dead may go, <br>
      and where few who find <br>
      such lands return, <br>
      or return many years <br>
      or centuries later, <br>
      still young until: <br>
      <br>
      they touch the ground, <br>
      as in the case of Oisín who rode atop <br>
      his love's Niamh's magical horse, <br>
      which could glide across the seas <br>
      just as easily as land <br>
      who returned to Ireland <br>
      300 years later. <br>
      <br>
      or open a forbidden jewelled box, <br>
      as in the case of Urashima Tarō, <br>
      who returned to Japan, after only 3 days <br>
      at Hōrai, discovering it was <br>
      300 years later. <br>
      <br>
      Many cultures discuss <br>
      across fractured histories, <br>
      such places of which <br>
      Bards sang or spoke <br>
      and Monks scribed <br>
      through shared stories, <br>
      myths and legends. <br>
      <br>
      For example, <br>
      the four treasures of the Tuath Dé <br>
      or Tribe of the Gods, <br>
      later known as Tuatha Dé Danann <br>
      or Folk of the Goddess Danu: <br>
      <br>
      From the isle of Murias the Coire Dagdae <br>
      or The Dagda's Cauldron, <br>
      an endless bowl filled <br>
      with whatever desired, <br>
      possibly later referred to as <br>
      The Holy Grail of Arthurian Legend. <br>
      <br>
      From the isle of Goirias, Sleá Bua <br>
      or Spear of Lú, from which flame flashed <br>
      said to later belong to Pisear, king of Persia <br>
      who kept it immersed in water to stop its flames. <br>
      <br>
      From the isle of Falias, Lia Fáil <br>
      or Stone of Destiny, <br>
      said to be the Coronation Stone of Tara, <br>
      for the High Kings of Ireland, <br>
      still seen on the Hill of Tara. <br>
      <br>
      From the isle of Findias, Claíomh Solais, <br>
      or Sword of Light, <br>
      similar to the Arthurian Legend of Excalibur, <br>
      where if held aloft by honourable persons, <br>
      a sword of flame or light. <br>
      <br>
      Such tales abound, <br>
      such meaning present. <br>
      Always conflicting tales, <br>
      always spun throughout history. <br>
      Across all cultures, <br>
      across all time. <br>

        <h3>Unbroken Line</h3>
      </a>
      a long line <br>
      drawn first on cave wall <br>
      from when first we uttered <br>
      under harried breath such muttering, <br>
      speech unintelligible to all <br>
      but kin and kind alike. Now he, she, they <br>
      write, type and think, <br>
      react and find beauty and maudlin sorrow <br>
      in the quiet words and loud imagery <br>
      splaid across screen and page, <br>
      seen by mind's eye <br>
      a long line <br>
      drawn at last to the final word, <br>
      not yet spoken, heard but often feared, <br>
      an idea passed from cry as babe <br>
      to single tear from aged eye, <br>
      wearied from sight of pain <br>
      and refreshed by memory <br>
      of being heard and seen and understood <br>
      the end unseen and passed from thought, <br>
      to worries saved, left by-the-by <br>
      for yet another day <br>
      a long line <br>
      unbroken <br>

      Take a breath, <br>
      have a cry <br>

      <br>
      Howl a curse <br>

      <br>
      The moment passes, <br>
      your heart is beating. <br>

      Fight the urge, <br>
      to be unfeeling. <br>
      <br>
      Love the world, <br>
      continue breathing.

    Content warning: attempted suicide. <br>

        <h3>A Cautionary Tale</h3>
      </a>
      I've been to the brink <br>
      between life and death, <br>
      breathing with assistance <br>
      via ventilator; <br>
      induced coma for 3 days. <br>
      <br>
      Passing massive amounts <br>
      of made-to-order, <br>
      ground-to-powder <br>
      mortared-and-pestled <br>
      hoarded antipsychotics <br>
      from mouth to GI tract, <br>
      that pounded my liver <br>
      and flooded my blood. <br>
      <br>
      Irony: <br>
      a drug designed <br>
      to ease the mind's <br>
      sixes and sevens, <br>
      knocking me for six. <br>
      <br>
      Without the easing <br>
      of blood to brain cell, <br>
      inducement of comatosity: <br>
      brain damage likely, <br>
      death a certainty. <br>
      <br>
      Without the breath <br>
      inspired by electrical systems <br>
      pumping to and fro <br>
      from my lungs, <br>
      to my heart, <br>
      to my arteries <br>
      and back through veins. <br>
      <br>
      I'd have passed <br>
      from this world <br>
      to the nothing <br>
      which awaits us all. <br>
      <br>
      I'm grateful <br>
      for another chance, <br>
      but I'm given <br>
      momentary pause, <br>
      from time to time, <br>
      a lingering question <br>
      to my lips. <br>
      <br>
      Did I perish? <br>
      Is this some reaction <br>
      to vegetation of my mind? <br>
      An illusion created by my hand, <br>
      a fatal overdose? <br>
      <br>
      A cautionary tale, <br>
      one told from me, <br>
      to you in earnest. <br>
      <br>
      If in doubt, in despair or pain, <br>
      there is nothing to take from this refrain, <br>
      but to seek out help, and muster strength. <br>
      <br>
      Enough to cry or yelp a pleading, <br>
      to a loved one, friend, <br>
      any heart a'bleeding.
