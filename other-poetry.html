      <p>
        I sat upright upon the cushion <br>
        Jammed betwixt panniers atop the rear wheel <br>
        Hanging on for dear comfort but also survival <br>
        His legs pumping pedals, my arms holding tight <br>
        His bulk and his jumper, thick as a tree <br>
        We rode along streets, as traffic abounded <br>
        The cacophony of lives, plain to see <br>
        Not by my small form, nor did head turn around <br>
        My face to his back was I pressed against <br>
        Not worried or fearful, was I of a fall <br>
        Trust in this man, did I place, so impressed <br>
        Of his position, still looming in my mind years hence <br>
        <br>
        Arrived at the store we did in a jiffy <br>
        Though my father did not gift me a toy <br>
        Instead simply stated at my wanting a thing <br>
        A garish yellow-green Super Soaker, <br>
        That I could save money and return later days <br>
        Though it didn't occur, he tried gifting me patience, <br>
        Knowing as I do, his intractable states, <br>
        No appeal, nor crocodile tears to manipulate <br>
        Instead I acknowledged his plan to distract <br>
        From my want, with which I would use to harass <br>
        My sister's at home and my friends unamused <br>
        Though thankful am I despite no seeming benefit <br>
        Am I for the lesson that day <br>
        The gift of his time, the ride quality <br>
        <br>
        Homeward bound do we travel, <br>
        Though my hands were not empty <br>
        Filled with knowledge and his form so plenty <br>
        A love and respect for my father, I see <br>
        Despite getting not what I desired, I did not fail to be <br>
        In awe of his stature, looming so large <br>
        At speed did we weave between cars <br>
        Homeward bound do we travel <br>
        Beneath pale blue sky, cycling smooth roads <br>
        As bike mounted curved street curb <br>
        Leading down cobble stoned alleys of old Dublin city <br>
        The memories not lost, so no use for some pity

      <p>
        I am from the psych ward, from <br>
        Rexulti, and hallucinations all the while. <br>
        I am from the dark in winter, green grass in sallow sun. <br>
        I am from the shamrock, the stinging nettle. <br>
        I am from teetotal and social intoxication, from genetic stocks known and unknown. <br>
        I am from talktative and friendly. <br>
        From hyper and disruptive. <br>
        I am from questioning why despite no seeming answer. <br>
        To the void I shout and scream for meaning, <br>
        to the text box I fill with my own. <br>
        I am from an endless migration, <br>
        fleeing famine and seeking opportunity, <br>
        from humble potato and churned butter. <br>
        From the slap across my face, to the glasses lost below, <br>
        consigning me to blurry reality, <br>
        and the heat of angered father's at inattentive sons. <br>
        I am from the mantelpiece, <br>
        above a fire never lit, <br>
        lost items from my childhood, <br>
        I am not ashamed to admit, <br>
        once as precious as my blood, <br>
        I would likely sell for profit,
        nothing good could come from memories they would elicit, <br>
        feelings best left in the past, <br>
        that show I care not a whit, <br>
        for violent scenes and children's screams, <br>
        water flowing down my throat, <br>
        drowning slowly bit by bit, <br>
        torn away from flowing tap, <br>
        just as quickly to confess, <br>
        sorrow for my attention-deficit, <br>
        hyperactive way of being.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>

        Justice should not be blind <br>
        To the inequality put forward by our presumed betters. <br>
        Impartiality can be achieved without the blindfold afront her eyes, <br>
        blinding the difficulties faced by poor policies and laws. <br>
        <br>
        Let us remove her 'fold atop her face, <br>
        and see her tears roll down both cheeks, <br>
        at what we have created.

    <div class="content">
      <p>

        Free will is an illusion
        and belief in freedom, <br>
        neither weakness nor strength; <br>
        we simply do not control our actions. <br>
        <br>
        We are the sum of our reactions <br>
        to the equal, opposite and neutral <br>
        from the Big Bang, long long ago. <br>
        <br>
        It is not free will <br>
        beckoning faith or hope or love, <br>
        but the complex ongoing reaction of the universe expressing itself.

        I am made of <br>
        stardust and sunlight; <br>
        water bonds me. <br>
        <br>
        Trillions of trees <br>
        fill my lungs, <br>
        the breath of life <br>
        fuels my function. <br>
        <br>
        The blood pumped <br>
        from my heart so full, <br>
        is the same as yours. <br>

        Blood may be thicker <br>
        than the water of origin, <br>
        but it is light and life <br>
        that propels us.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">December 28th, 2021 - <br>Evolution not Revolution</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>

        I am not interested in revolution. <br>
        As the past is buried and forgotten too many times <br>
        through initial force, responsibility is displaced <br>
        by the charisma of leaders, usually ill-suited to responsibility. <br>
        <br>
        I am interested in evolution, <br>
        of form and function of processes <br>
        designed to instil progress towards <br>
        a lack of inequality and deprivation, <br>
        of sustainable growth of both technology <br>
        and provision of the basic needs <br>
        and wants of our collective population. <br>
        <br>
        We are one race, of many isles and masses, <br>
        from one small mote shielded by the bright of a single white star, <br>
        with a shared history and culture developed <br>
        by communication, travel and tragedy. <br>
        <br>
        To shed the past in form of revolution, <br>
        is to discount the lessons learned, <br>
        as whilst every action has a reaction <br>
        there is an equal, opposite and neutral reaction <br>
        to the force involved in such a plot.

    <div class="content">
      <p>

        As I stared through the window, at a family not mine <br>
        From the outside looking in, though, her dress caught my eye, <br>
        Scarlet red and gleaming, alike blood spilt on snow, <br>
        Fine cutlery, now moving at rapid pace, my eye drawn to her bow, <br>
        I now watch with a fear whilst my hunger grows, <br>
        For revenge for my sister, and seeing such awful repose <br>
        A crime disappearing, whilst creating such glee <br>
        On faces speckled with flesh, my sister's innate purity <br>
        Eat the rich, I should say, as their punishment must fit <br>
        This dark awakening in life, to writing I submit</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>

        I come from a place of privilege <br>
        where chances flock to me <br>
        due to characteristics <br>
        determined by chance. <br>
        From my pink skinned eyelids <br>
        I open my blue eyes. <br>
        From my male gaze <br>
        I count imposed disparities, <br>
        between the sexes. <br>
        I see discrimination, <br>
        between ethnicities. <br>
        I stand askance on cultural barriers, <br>
        built over generations, and view <br>
        impositions, hardships and atrocities. <br>
        I contribute little to improve <br>
        the lot of the many, <br>
        affected by hatred and bigotry, <br>
        and this is nothing but guilt, <br>
        typing privilege on technology <br>
        manufactured by slavery <br>
        of work, thought and time.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">December 27th, 2021 - <br>Responsibility of all</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>

        I remember a night <br>
        I felt burdened by the world <br>
        and rejected the concept of sovereignty, <br>
        rejected the need for a crown of power. <br>
        <br>
        It is for all, the need to be responsible. <br>
        It is for all, the staying of the need to be powerful. <br>
        <br>
        When those who seek power, succeed and act poorly, <br>
        it is a reflection of the cognitive dissonance <br>
        surrounding the true nature of power. <br>
        <br>
        When power is wielded by those that sought it out, <br>
        it appears willy nilly and soaked in the blood of previous mistaken attempts. <br>
        <br>
        We all bear this power, without need of seeking, <br>
        as power is the responsibility of all, given to the minute few.

          A shakiness to my hands, <br>
          upturned palms at which I stare <br>
          the weight placed upon me, <br>
          by myself, and no-one else. <br>
          <br>
          Power doesn't suit, <br>
          and responsibility hurts. <br>
          The ills that plague us, <br>
          terrible and true, <br>
          are at odds with my disposition, <br>
          and beckon for attention. <br>
          Truly, to know your place, <br>
          is to lie to others, <br>
          about their situation. <br>

            Long ago across the seas, <br>
            were distant isles, <br>
            covered by apple trees <br>
            forever leaved green, <br>
            and flowers always in bloom. <br>
            <br>
            The Otherworld of Eternal Youth or Tír na nÓg, <br>
            Mag Mell, or the Plain of Delight, <br>
            Tír fo Thuinn, or Land under the Wave, <br>
            Emain Ablach, or the Isle of Apple Trees, <br>
            Tír Tairngire, or the Land of Promise, <br>
            otherwise Annwn to the Welsh <br>
            or Avalon to the English, <br>
            erstwhile Penglai or Hōrai, island of Immortals, <br>
            to the Chinese or Japanese, respectively, <br>
            the isles Muirias, Falias, Goirias and Findias, <br>
            possibly Elysium, <br>
            or even Atlantis. <br>
            <br>
            Mystical isles where fae/fairy mixed with Gods, <br>
            from which come mythical tales of jewels from trees, <br>
            endless food and drink, <br>
            swine that regenerated daily, <br>
            and trees with silver branches, <br>
            gold and silver buildings, <br>
            immortality granted from springs, <br>
            or from fruits <br>
            or ales or wines <br>
            that heal the sick <br>
            or raise the dead. <br>
            <br>
            Tales of mythical lands <br>
            that humans oft used to seek out, <br>
            but nary find, due to mystical fog <br>
            and seas with tides either weak or strong. <br>
            <br>
            Where the dead may go, <br>
            and where few who find <br>
            such lands return, <br>
            or return many years <br>
            or centuries later, <br>
            still young until: <br>
            <br>
            they touch the ground, <br>
            as in the case of Oisín who rode atop <br>
            his love's Niamh's magical horse, <br>
            which could glide across the seas <br>
            just as easily as land <br>
            who returned to Ireland <br>
            300 years later. <br>
            <br>
            or open a forbidden jewelled box, <br>
            as in the case of Urashima Tarō, <br>
            who returned to Japan, after only 3 days <br>
            at Hōrai, discovering it was <br>
            300 years later. <br>
            <br>
            Many cultures discuss <br>
            across fractured histories, <br>
            such places of which <br>
            Bards sang or spoke <br>
            and Monks scribed <br>
            through shared stories, <br>
            myths and legends. <br>
            <br>
            For example, <br>
            the four treasures of the Tuath Dé <br>
            or Tribe of the Gods, <br>
            later known as Tuatha Dé Danann <br>
            or Folk of the Goddess Danu: <br>
            <br>
            From the isle of Murias the Coire Dagdae <br>
            or The Dagda's Cauldron, <br>
            an endless bowl filled <br>
            with whatever desired, <br>
            possibly later referred to as <br>
            The Holy Grail of Arthurian Legend. <br>
            <br>
            From the isle of Goirias, Sleá Bua <br>
            or Spear of Lú, from which flame flashed <br>
            said to later belong to Pisear, king of Persia <br>
            who kept it immersed in water to stop its flames. <br>
            <br>
            From the isle of Falias, Lia Fáil <br>
            or Stone of Destiny, <br>
            said to be the Coronation Stone of Tara, <br>
            for the High Kings of Ireland, <br>
            still seen on the Hill of Tara. <br>
            <br>
            From the isle of Findias, Claíomh Solais, <br>
            or Sword of Light, <br>
            similar to the Arthurian Legend of Excalibur, <br>
            where if held aloft by honourable persons, <br>
            a sword of flame or light. <br>
            <br>
            Such tales abound, <br>
            such meaning present. <br>
            Always conflicting tales, <br>
            always spun throughout history. <br>
            Across all cultures, <br>
            across all time. <br>

                  I've been to the brink <br>
                  between life and death, <br>
                  breathing with assistance <br>
                  via ventilator; <br>
                  induced coma for 3 days. <br>
                  <br>
                  Passing massive amounts <br>
                  of made-to-order, <br>
                  ground-to-powder <br>
                  mortared-and-pestled <br>
                  hoarded antipsychotics <br>
                  from mouth to GI tract, <br>
                  that pounded my liver <br>
                  and flooded my blood. <br>
                  <br>
                  Irony: <br>
                  a drug designed <br>

                  sixes and sevens, <br>
                  knocking me for six. <br>
                  <br>
                  Without the easing <br>
                  of blood to brain cell, <br>
                  inducement of comatosity: <br>
                  brain damage likely, <br>
                  death a certainty. <br>
                  <br>
                  Without the breath <br>
                  inspired by electrical systems <br>
                  pumping to and fro <br>
                  from my lungs, <br>

                  <br>
                  I'd have passed <br>
                  from this world <br>
                  to the nothing <br>
                  which awaits us all. <br>
                  <br>
                  I'm grateful <br>
                  for another chance, <br>
                  but I'm given <br>
                  momentary pause, <br>
                  from time to time, <br>
                  a lingering question <br>
                  to my lips. <br>
                  <br>
                  Did I perish? <br>
                  Is this some reaction <br>
                  to vegetation of my mind? <br>
                  An illusion created by my hand, <br>
                  a fatal overdose? <br>
                  <br>
                  A cautionary tale, <br>
                  one told from me, <br>
                  to you in earnest. <br>
                  <br>
                  If in doubt, in despair or pain, <br>
                  there is nothing to take from this refrain, <br>
                  but to seek out help, and muster strength. <br>
                  <br>
                  Enough to cry or yelp a pleading, <br>
                  to a loved one, friend, <br>

                  “Ah, I feel a sadness on me, Dane. That's how the Irish people say it. <br>
                  In their language, you can't say, "I am sad," or "I am happy". <br>
                  They understood what we English have long forgot. <br>
                  We're not our sadness. We're not our happiness or our pain <br>
                  but our language hypnotizes us and traps us in little labelled boxes.” <br>
                  <br>
                  ― Grant Morrison, The Invisibles, Volume 1: Say You Want a Revolution <br>
                  <br>
                  I come from a people, <br>
                  who were simultaneously <br>
                  opressed by a colonial power, <br>
                  and exploited by a religion, <br>
                  who conjointly delayed our own cultural progress <br>
                  and destroyed our connection with our language and history. <br>
                  <br>
                  The language does feature heavily, <br>
                  required by law in current times, <br>
                  to be on signs, currency, legislation <br>
                  and taught as many say, <br>
                  including myself, in a backward capacity <br>
                  in schools across our country. <br>
                  <br>
                  So much is the language, <br>
                  considered at once 'dead' and 'in revival', <br>
                  rooted in the past, <br>
                  steeped in religious mysticism, <br>
                  of a power originating in the Roman Catholic Church, <br>
                  that our standard hello is, <br>
                  Dia Dhuit or Dia is Muire Dhuit = <br>

                  Diarmaid Mac Murchadha <br>
                  a lowly King of Leinster, deposed. <br>
                  Who stole the bride of another King <br>
                  and is more currently despised. <br>
                  Who sought help from Henry II to bring <br>
                  the help of the English monarch and <br>
                  Anglo-Norman armies, a return to his throne. <br>
                  Instead they raided, divided and raped <br>
                  what is now known as Ireland. <br>
                  <br>
                  From relatively peaceful, "semi-pagan", <br>
                  poly-theistic and Celtic Christian, <br>
                  one country, divided under many Kings, <br>
                  once Inisfáil, the Island of Destiny. <br>
                  <br>
                  At once one country, under one High King, or Ard Rí <br>
                  The Kingdoms of Ailech, Airgíalla, Connacht, <br>
                  Leinster, Mide, Osraige, Munster, Thomond, Ulaid. <br>
                  <br>
                  At once one culture, then divided <br>
                  under Anglo-Norman rule. <br>
                  Henry II gave the entire island, <br>
                  to his son once of age, John. <br>
                  Then known as Dominus Hiberniae, <br>
                  and later the Kingdom of Ireland. <br>
                  Still split today, by one deposed <br>
                  King's petulance and pride. <br>
                  <br>
                  The last of Irish rule to fall, <br>
                  to the people claiming they were <br>
                  "more Irish than the Irish themselves" <br>
                  known as the Old English, was ironically <br>
                  the territory of Ui Neill, known currently <br>
                  (six of the nine counties of Ulster) <br>
                  as Northern Ireland. <br>
                  <br>
                  Hold steadfast to the last of division <br>
                  for, finally, a united Ireland will come in time. <br>

                  This is highly controversial, in my opinion, <br>
                  as it comes from a very basic, non-tertiary educated <br>
                  understanding of the universe in general; however <br>
                  I feel compelled to think about such matters, <br>
                  and this is my long-standing reaction. <br>
                  <br>
                  The universe can be distilled <br>
                  in logical terms to a representation of <br>
                  +1,-1 and 0 <br>
                  where 0 cannot exist, where 0 is undefined <br>
                  a limit unable to be reached, <br>
                  where -1 is the expression of the +1 at rest, <br>
                  tending towards entropy, but never reaching 0. <br>
                  <br>
                  The creation and accelerating expansion of <br>
                  what we perceive as the vast expanse of space, <br>
                  comes from the -1, of the ever reacting <br>
                  in an equal, opposite and near-neutral +1 <br>
                  and whilst the vacuum of space is not simply a medium <br>
                  to be passed through, but the moments of expressed energy <br>
                  tending towards 0, whilst never completely massless. <br>
                  <br>
                  Dark Matter does not exist, and therefore cannot be detected <br>
                  as we are blind to near massless past expressions of energy. <br>
                  <br>
                  Low Energy Physics must be explored in greater depths,<br>
                  as we perceivably attempt with High Energy Physics,<br>
                  as understanding such holds the key <br>
                  to the unifying principle of universal energy.

                  But understand that the alternative is lesser. <br>
                  <br>
                  Their livelihoods and lives counting upwards, <br>
                  a purposeful abstract removal of the damage <br>
                  more than a number on a toll, <br>
                  paid by their very lives and consciousness on this plane. <br>

                  My first poem was to beauty I did see <br>
                  To a teenage infatuation, I have since set free <br>
                  At school on just another ordinary day <br>
                  the ugly side of teenage romance not to be. <br>
                  <br>
                  Without knowing what love could hold <br>
                  Without knowing who really she was <br>
                  Without knowing how she felt like to kiss <br>
                  Without knowing where she felt at peace <br>
                  Without knowing when to ever have to say; <br>
                  "... You are perfection personified" <br>
                  Without knowing if, anyone, could really be <br>
                  Without knowing when rejection should be expected <br>
                  Until she laughed in response <br>
                  to my awkward confession in a computer lab, <br>
                  from prose writ with innocent intent and ignorance only youth can muster <br>
                  <br>
                  I regret the silence, I left in response <br>
                  I regret the anger, and I regret the pain <br>
                  but I'll never regret or forget <br>
                  the rose or my statement, <br>
                  as I simply did not know her, <br>
                  or indeed who she's come to be, <br>
                  nor even her face as she laughed as I read. <br>
                  <br>
                  Such beauty still existed in cruelty, <br>
                  like love intended to never be, <br>
                  and even love that has occurred to me. <br>
                  <br>
                  The regrets idle away in my mind: <br>
                  How I reacted, alone with noone to see <br>
                  The anger to punch a wooden pole, and the <br>
                  luck that it was only my heart that did break. <br>

                  May the ceiling shatter <br>
                  And be caught by a web woven by women <br>
                  To protect all those under foot and <br>

                  must climb through glass <br>

                  steers through accelerating expansion of the new, <br>

                  I awoke in terror, from a nightmare, <br>
                  to push away the fear and pull <br>
                  at one of the only threads of emotional <br>
                  support in my life, for what felt like minutes <br>
                  in the darkness of an unfamiliar room. <br>
                  I pulled and pushed on my partner, <br>
                  to rouse some empathy only <br>
                  to foster fear more fiercely <br>
                  at my inability to cope with fiction <br>
                  to wake my love and shake my dread <br>
                  hoping that she wasn’t dead <br>
                  to discover moments later, the fiction <br>
                  had not ended, that I was still asleep. <br>
                  The dull and dreary darkness, <br>
                  marred by a figure by the corner <br>
                  darker still than night, a deeper black, <br>
                  to my vision a figment that cast such a <br>
                  shadow of doubt; did I sleep still, <br>
                  not nearly slumbering but clambering <br>
                  between the figments and the facts? <br>
                  My torch turned on to touch of tip <br>
                  to tempered glass of fingers grasping, <br>
                  cold metal frame of phone comforting, <br>
                  elucidating the vision of the deep dark <br>
                  figure of slight stature, my focussed eyes <br>
                  bearing witness to illuminated clothes, <br>
                  hanging from a stand discarded at end <br>
                  of day to welcome sleep, not knowing <br>
                  what awaited nor wanting such a fright, <br>
                  a frenzied act via skilful tact of trusty technology <br>
                  to deny a feared fiction foothold in reality, <br>
                  denied in moments my fear retreated at a glacial pace. <br>
                  Four hours later, still awake now dawn of day, <br>
                  with sight of sun sought simply, <br>
                  seeping from behind drawn curtains <br>
                  to slick across the wood panelled walls <br>
                  of a holiday home in which I feel <br>
                  unwelcome to sleep further still, and <br>
                  as I seek the courage to dispel the dreams <br>
                  unwelcome, I find no solace in the stillness, <br>
                  only questions still.

                  Guilt leads to temptation to give in <br>
                  to let go if only just for moments in a life <br>
                  filled with focus and acute dysfunction. <br>
                  Ever-shifting, satisfied in the moment, <br>

                  Let my life never end. <br>
                  I wish to never experience nothing itself, <br>
                  and forever to wish to be, experiencing what we dub <br>
                  will that’s free; to enjoy moments <br>
                  of perception of the good that can <br>
