      <p>
        I sat upright upon the cushion <br>
        Jammed betwixt panniers atop the rear wheel <br>
        Hanging on for dear comfort but also survival <br>
        His legs pumping pedals, my arms holding tight <br>
        His bulk and his jumper, thick as a tree <br>
        We rode along streets, as traffic abounded <br>
        The cacophony of lives, plain to see <br>
        Not by my small form, nor did head turn around <br>
        My face to his back was I pressed against <br>
        Not worried or fearful, was I of a fall <br>
        Trust in this man, did I place, so impressed <br>
        Of his position, still looming in my mind years hence <br>
        <br>
        Arrived at the store we did in a jiffy <br>
        Though my father did not gift me a toy <br>
        Instead simply stated at my wanting a thing <br>
        A garish yellow-green Super Soaker, <br>
        That I could save money and return later days <br>
        Though it didn't occur, he tried gifting me patience, <br>
        Knowing as I do, his intractable states, <br>
        No appeal, nor crocodile tears to manipulate <br>
        Instead I acknowledged his plan to distract <br>
        From my want, with which I would use to harass <br>
        My sister's at home and my friends unamused <br>
        Though thankful am I despite no seeming benefit <br>
        Am I for the lesson that day <br>
        The gift of his time, the ride quality <br>
        <br>
        Homeward bound do we travel, <br>
        Though my hands were not empty <br>
        Filled with knowledge and his form so plenty <br>
        A love and respect for my father, I see <br>
        Despite getting not what I desired, I did not fail to be <br>
        In awe of his stature, looming so large <br>
        At speed did we weave between cars <br>
        Homeward bound do we travel <br>
        Beneath pale blue sky, cycling smooth roads <br>
        As bike mounted curved street curb <br>
        Leading down cobble stoned alleys of old Dublin city <br>
        The memories not lost, so no use for some pity

      <p>
        I am from the psych ward, from <br>
        Rexulti, and hallucinations all the while. <br>
        I am from the dark in winter, green grass in sallow sun. <br>
        I am from the shamrock, the stinging nettle. <br>
        I am from teetotal and social intoxication, from genetic stocks known and unknown. <br>
        I am from talktative and friendly. <br>
        From hyper and disruptive. <br>
        I am from questioning why despite no seeming answer. <br>
        To the void I shout and scream for meaning, <br>
        to the text box I fill with my own. <br>
        I am from an endless migration, <br>
        fleeing famine and seeking opportunity, <br>
        from humble potato and churned butter. <br>
        From the slap across my face, to the glasses lost below, <br>
        consigning me to blurry reality, <br>
        and the heat of angered father's at inattentive sons. <br>
        I am from the mantelpiece, <br>
        above a fire never lit, <br>
        lost items from my childhood, <br>
        I am not ashamed to admit, <br>
        once as precious as my blood, <br>
        I would likely sell for profit,
        nothing good could come from memories they would elicit, <br>
        feelings best left in the past, <br>
        that show I care not a whit, <br>
        for violent scenes and children's screams, <br>
        water flowing down my throat, <br>
        drowning slowly bit by bit, <br>
        torn away from flowing tap, <br>
        just as quickly to confess, <br>
        sorrow for my attention-deficit, <br>
        hyperactive way of being.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Justice should not be blind <br>
        To the inequality put forward by our presumed betters. <br>
        Impartiality can be achieved without the blindfold afront her eyes, <br>
        blinding the difficulties faced by poor policies and laws. <br>
        <br>
        Let us remove her 'fold atop her face, <br>
        and see her tears roll down both cheeks, <br>
        at what we have created.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Free will is an illusion
        and belief in freedom, <br>
        neither weakness nor strength; <br>
        we simply do not control our actions. <br>
        <br>
        We are the sum of our reactions <br>
        to the equal, opposite and neutral <br>
        from the Big Bang, long long ago. <br>
        <br>
        It is not free will <br>
        beckoning faith or hope or love, <br>
        but the complex ongoing reaction of the universe expressing itself.

        Trillions of trees <br>
        fill my lungs, <br>

        The blood pumped <br>
        from my heart so full, <br>
        is the same as yours. <br>

        Blood may be thicker <br>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">December 28th, 2021 - <br>Evolution not Revolution</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I am not interested in revolution. <br>
        As the past is buried and forgotten too many times <br>
        through initial force, responsibility is displaced <br>
        by the charisma of leaders, usually ill-suited to responsibility. <br>
        <br>
        I am interested in evolution, <br>
        of form and function of processes <br>
        designed to instil progress towards <br>
        a lack of inequality and deprivation, <br>
        of sustainable growth of both technology <br>
        and provision of the basic needs <br>
        and wants of our collective population. <br>
        <br>
        We are one race, of many isles and masses, <br>
        from one small mote shielded by the bright of a single white star, <br>
        with a shared history and culture developed <br>
        by communication, travel and tragedy. <br>
        <br>
        To shed the past in form of revolution, <br>
        is to discount the lessons learned, <br>
        as whilst every action has a reaction <br>
        there is an equal, opposite and neutral reaction <br>
        to the force involved in such a plot.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        As I stared through the window, at a family not mine <br>
        From the outside looking in, though, her dress caught my eye, <br>
        Scarlet red and gleaming, alike blood spilt on snow, <br>
        Fine cutlery, now moving at rapid pace, my eye drawn to her bow, <br>
        I now watch with a fear whilst my hunger grows, <br>
        For revenge for my sister, and seeing such awful repose <br>
        A crime disappearing, whilst creating such glee <br>
        On faces speckled with flesh, my sister's innate purity <br>
        Eat the rich, I should say, as their punishment must fit <br>
        This dark awakening in life, to writing I submit</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I come from a place of privilege <br>
        where chances flock to me <br>
        due to characteristics <br>
        determined by chance. <br>
        From my pink skinned eyelids <br>
        I open my blue eyes. <br>
        From my male gaze <br>
        I count imposed disparities, <br>
        between the sexes. <br>
        I see discrimination, <br>
        between ethnicities. <br>
        I stand askance on cultural barriers, <br>
        built over generations, and view <br>
        impositions, hardships and atrocities. <br>
        I contribute little to improve <br>
        the lot of the many, <br>
        affected by hatred and bigotry, <br>
        and this is nothing but guilt, <br>
        typing privilege on technology <br>
        manufactured by slavery <br>
        of work, thought and time.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">December 27th, 2021 - <br>Responsibility of all</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I remember a night <br>
        I felt burdened by the world <br>
        and rejected the concept of sovereignty, <br>
        rejected the need for a crown of power. <br>
        <br>
        It is for all, the need to be responsible. <br>
        It is for all, the staying of the need to be powerful. <br>
        <br>
        When those who seek power, succeed and act poorly, <br>
        it is a reflection of the cognitive dissonance <br>
        surrounding the true nature of power. <br>
        <br>
        When power is wielded by those that sought it out, <br>
        it appears willy nilly and soaked in the blood of previous mistaken attempts. <br>
        <br>
        We all bear this power, without need of seeking, <br>
        as power is the responsibility of all, given to the minute few.

        Long ago across the seas, <br>
        were distant isles, <br>
        covered by apple trees <br>
        forever leaved green, <br>
        and flowers always in bloom. <br>
        <br>
        The Otherworld of Eternal Youth or Tír na nÓg, <br>
        Mag Mell, or the Plain of Delight, <br>
        Tír fo Thuinn, or Land under the Wave, <br>
        Emain Ablach, or the Isle of Apple Trees, <br>
        Tír Tairngire, or the Land of Promise, <br>
        otherwise Annwn to the Welsh <br>
        or Avalon to the English, <br>
        erstwhile Penglai or Hōrai, island of Immortals, <br>
        to the Chinese or Japanese, respectively, <br>
        the isles Muirias, Falias, Goirias and Findias, <br>
        possibly Elysium, <br>
        or even Atlantis. <br>
        <br>
        Mystical isles where fae/fairy mixed with Gods, <br>
        from which come mythical tales of jewels from trees, <br>
        endless food and drink, <br>
        swine that regenerated daily, <br>
        and trees with silver branches, <br>
        gold and silver buildings, <br>
        immortality granted from springs, <br>
        or from fruits <br>
        or ales or wines <br>
        that heal the sick <br>
        or raise the dead. <br>
        <br>
        Tales of mythical lands <br>
        that humans oft used to seek out, <br>
        but nary find, due to mystical fog <br>
        and seas with tides either weak or strong. <br>
        <br>
        Where the dead may go, <br>
        and where few who find <br>
        such lands return, <br>
        or return many years <br>
        or centuries later, <br>
        still young until: <br>
        <br>
        they touch the ground, <br>
        as in the case of Oisín who rode atop <br>
        his love's Niamh's magical horse, <br>
        which could glide across the seas <br>
        just as easily as land <br>
        who returned to Ireland <br>
        300 years later. <br>
        <br>
        or open a forbidden jewelled box, <br>
        as in the case of Urashima Tarō, <br>
        who returned to Japan, after only 3 days <br>
        at Hōrai, discovering it was <br>
        300 years later. <br>
        <br>
        Many cultures discuss <br>
        across fractured histories, <br>
        such places of which <br>
        Bards sang or spoke <br>
        and Monks scribed <br>
        through shared stories, <br>
        myths and legends. <br>
        <br>
        For example, <br>
        the four treasures of the Tuath Dé <br>
        or Tribe of the Gods, <br>
        later known as Tuatha Dé Danann <br>
        or Folk of the Goddess Danu: <br>
        <br>
        From the isle of Murias the Coire Dagdae <br>
        or The Dagda's Cauldron, <br>
        an endless bowl filled <br>
        with whatever desired, <br>
        possibly later referred to as <br>
        The Holy Grail of Arthurian Legend. <br>
        <br>
        From the isle of Goirias, Sleá Bua <br>
        or Spear of Lú, from which flame flashed <br>
        said to later belong to Pisear, king of Persia <br>
        who kept it immersed in water to stop its flames. <br>
        <br>
        From the isle of Falias, Lia Fáil <br>
        or Stone of Destiny, <br>
        said to be the Coronation Stone of Tara, <br>
        for the High Kings of Ireland, <br>
        still seen on the Hill of Tara. <br>
        <br>
        From the isle of Findias, Claíomh Solais, <br>
        or Sword of Light, <br>
        similar to the Arthurian Legend of Excalibur, <br>
        where if held aloft by honourable persons, <br>
        a sword of flame or light. <br>
        <br>
        Such tales abound, <br>
        such meaning present. <br>
        Always conflicting tales, <br>
        always spun throughout history. <br>
        Across all cultures, <br>
        across all time. <br>

      <p>

        I've been to the brink <br>
        between life and death, <br>
        breathing with assistance <br>
        via ventilator; <br>
        induced coma for 3 days. <br>
        <br>
        Passing massive amounts <br>

        mortared-and-pestled <br>
        hoarded antipsychotics <br>
        from mouth to GI tract, <br>

        and flooded my blood. <br>
        <br>
        Irony: <br>
        a drug designed <br>
        to ease the mind's <br>
        sixes and sevens, <br>
        knocking me for six. <br>
        <br>
        Without the easing <br>
        of blood to brain cell, <br>
        inducement of comatosity: <br>
        brain damage likely, <br>
        death a certainty. <br>
        <br>
        Without the breath <br>
        inspired by electrical systems <br>
        pumping to and fro <br>
        from my lungs, <br>
        to my heart, <br>
        to my arteries <br>
        and back through veins. <br>
        <br>
        I'd have passed <br>
        from this world <br>

        which awaits us all. <br>
        <br>
        I'm grateful <br>
        for another chance, <br>
        but I'm given <br>
        momentary pause, <br>
        from time to time, <br>
        a lingering question <br>
        to my lips. <br>
        <br>
        Did I perish? <br>
        Is this some reaction <br>
        to vegetation of my mind? <br>
        An illusion created by my hand, <br>
        a fatal overdose? <br>
        <br>
        A cautionary tale, <br>
        one told from me, <br>
        to you in earnest. <br>
        <br>
        If in doubt, in despair or pain, <br>
        there is nothing to take from this refrain, <br>
        but to seek out help, and muster strength. <br>
        <br>
        Enough to cry or yelp a pleading, <br>
        to a loved one, friend, <br>
        any heart a'bleeding.

        “Ah, I feel a sadness on me, Dane. That's how the Irish people say it. <br>
        In their language, you can't say, "I am sad," or "I am happy". <br>
        They understood what we English have long forgot. <br>
        We're not our sadness. We're not our happiness or our pain <br>
        but our language hypnotizes us and traps us in little labelled boxes.” <br>
        <br>
        ― Grant Morrison, The Invisibles, Volume 1: Say You Want a Revolution <br>
        <br>
        I come from a people, <br>
        who were simultaneously <br>
        opressed by a colonial power, <br>
        and exploited by a religion, <br>
        who conjointly delayed our own cultural progress <br>
        and destroyed our connection with our language and history. <br>
        <br>
        The language does feature heavily, <br>
        required by law in current times, <br>
        to be on signs, currency, legislation <br>
        and taught as many say, <br>
        including myself, in a backward capacity <br>
        in schools across our country. <br>
        <br>
        So much is the language, <br>
        considered at once 'dead' and 'in revival', <br>
        rooted in the past, <br>
        steeped in religious mysticism, <br>
        of a power originating in the Roman Catholic Church, <br>
        that our standard hello is, <br>
        Dia Dhuit or Dia is Muire Dhuit = <br>
        'God be with you' or 'God and Mary be with you' <br>
        <br>
        I may have left my home for another long ago, <br>
        and I may have barely passed or failed my studies <br>
        in a language taught poorly and disrespected by doing so, <br>
        but I retain my connection like many do, <br>
        with fondness and love in my heart. <br>

        Diarmaid Mac Murchadha <br>
        a lowly King of Leinster, deposed. <br>
        Who stole the bride of another King <br>
        and is more currently despised. <br>
        Who sought help from Henry II to bring <br>
        the help of the English monarch and <br>
        Anglo-Norman armies, a return to his throne. <br>
        Instead they raided, divided and raped <br>
        what is now known as Ireland. <br>
        <br>
        From relatively peaceful, "semi-pagan", <br>
        poly-theistic and Celtic Christian, <br>
        one country, divided under many Kings, <br>
        once Inisfáil, the Island of Destiny. <br>
        <br>
        At once one country, under one High King, or Ard Rí <br>
        The Kingdoms of Ailech, Airgíalla, Connacht, <br>
        Leinster, Mide, Osraige, Munster, Thomond, Ulaid. <br>
        <br>
        At once one culture, then divided <br>
        under Anglo-Norman rule. <br>
        Henry II gave the entire island, <br>
        to his son once of age, John. <br>
        Then known as Dominus Hiberniae, <br>
        and later the Kingdom of Ireland. <br>
        Still split today, by one deposed <br>
        King's petulance and pride. <br>
        <br>
        The last of Irish rule to fall, <br>
        to the people claiming they were <br>
        "more Irish than the Irish themselves" <br>
        known as the Old English, was ironically <br>
        the territory of Ui Neill, known currently <br>
        (six of the nine counties of Ulster) <br>
        as Northern Ireland. <br>

        This is highly controversial, in my opinion, <br>
        as it comes from a very basic, non-tertiary educated <br>
        understanding of the universe in general; however <br>
        I feel compelled to think about such matters, <br>
        and this is my long-standing reaction. <br>
        <br>
        The universe can be distilled <br>
        in logical terms to a representation of <br>
        +1,-1 and 0 <br>
        where 0 cannot exist, where 0 is undefined <br>
        a limit unable to be reached, <br>
        where -1 is the expression of the +1 at rest, <br>
        tending towards entropy, but never reaching 0. <br>
        <br>
        The creation and accelerating expansion of <br>
        what we perceive as the vast expanse of space, <br>
        comes from the -1, of the ever reacting <br>
        in an equal, opposite and near-neutral +1 <br>
        and whilst the vacuum of space is not simply a medium <br>
        to be passed through, but the moments of expressed energy <br>
        tending towards 0, whilst never completely massless. <br>
        <br>
        Dark Matter does not exist, and therefore cannot be detected <br>
        as we are blind to near massless past expressions of energy. <br>
        <br>
        Low Energy Physics must be explored in greater depths,<br>
        as we perceivably attempt with High Energy Physics,<br>
        as understanding such holds the key <br>
        to the unifying principle of universal energy.

        the ugly side of teenage romance not to be. <br>

        Without knowing how she felt like to kiss <br>
        Without knowing where she felt at peace <br>
        Without knowing when to ever have to say; <br>
        "... You are perfection personified" <br>
        Without knowing if, anyone, could really be <br>
        Without knowing when rejection should be expected <br>
        Until she laughed in response <br>
        to my awkward confession in a computer lab, <br>
        from prose writ with innocent intent and ignorance only youth can muster <br>
        <br>

        The regrets idle away in my mind: <br>

        not nearly slumbering but clambering <br>
        between the figments and the facts? <br>
        My torch turned on to touch of tip <br>
        to tempered glass of fingers grasping, <br>
        cold metal frame of phone comforting, <br>
        elucidating the vision of the deep dark <br>
        figure of slight stature, my focussed eyes <br>
        bearing witness to illuminated clothes, <br>
        hanging from a stand discarded at end <br>
        of day to welcome sleep, not knowing <br>
        what awaited nor wanting such a fright, <br>
        a frenzied act via skilful tact of trusty technology <br>
        to deny a feared fiction foothold in reality, <br>
        denied in moments my fear retreated at a glacial pace. <br>
        Four hours later, still awake now dawn of day, <br>
        with sight of sun sought simply, <br>
        seeping from behind drawn curtains <br>
        to slick across the wood panelled walls <br>
        of a holiday home in which I feel <br>
        unwelcome to sleep further still, and <br>
        as I seek the courage to dispel the dreams <br>
        unwelcome, I find no solace in the stillness, <br>
        only questions still.

        To the scurry and flurry of activity within, on the wheel inside its home, it paced <br>
        The gerbil ran and ran, a journey nowhere. Failing to keep up with the spinning wheel <br>
        It fell and floundered to one side, in straw. Feeling down at its struggle <br>
        A small hand gingerly opened the cage door. Gentle fur touched skin <br>
        Resistance to the grasp, claws scratching. Once, twice, never drawing blood <br>
        A bite to an eager child’s hand, my own. And fell it did, this time further still <br>
        To the floor and to its feet. Gravity delivering a graceful landing <br>
        The curiosity the gerbil must have felt, I ponder sometimes as to its expanse <br>
        To its conscious effort to escape, whilst moments prior, happily ensconced in a cage <br>
        A plastic wrapper, to an Ice Pole, brand name forgotten, and its flavour <br>
        Its existence on the floor, a child’s mistake. But to the gerbil, something more <br>
        It bit and tore at plastic with large teeth. Blood appeared, at side of the little mouth <br>
        Spurting, dribs and drabs on wooden floor, a scared child scarpered to pick the gerbil up <br>
        It shook and shook and would not stop, a seizure or heart attack, unknown even now <br>
        Until it was still, a final journey nowhere

        It’s happened to all of us <br>
        Perusing our extensive medical histories <br>
        Notes from our psychiatric team, <br>
        our litany of suicide attempts <br>
        Lamenting our 20s, and our first attempt <br>
        Lacerations to our wrist, yellow fat cells ‘neath skin <br>
        Missing our veins, artery by millimetres <br>
        <br>
        It’s happened to all of us <br>
        Being caught in our private psych ward room <br>
        Using sheets to try to hang ourself <br>
        Spending the night in High Dependency <br>
        Monitored and checked by torchlight <br>
        By concerned nurses through our door <br>
        Hallucinating a cat climbing over our body <br>
        <br>
        It’s happened to all of us <br>
        Discovering that our coma via major overdose, <br>
        was not our only one <br>
        Two other separate occasions, admissions to the ICU <br>
        Dodging death due to flight/fight <br>

        It’s happened to all of us <br>
        The lack of memories surrounding <br>
        Our admission, our discharge <br>
        Our short stay in hospital <br>
        We remember hazily ramming two boxes <br>
        Of antipsychotic medication <br>
        Down our throats on a park bench, homeless <br>
        Garnered from a psychiatrist <br>
        We lied to that day, about suicidal intent <br>
        Falling into a taxi, passing out <br>
        Waking up on our side, a non-descript ward <br>
        Thinking our stomach had been pumped <br>
        As for the third ICU stay, our memory blank <br>
        <br>
        It’s happened to all of us <br>
        That feeling of disorientation <br>
        The confronting nature of our past, <br>
        over failed attempts on our life <br>
        Of our lucky happenstance to suffer still <br>
        Our commitment to live, and our questioning <br>
        Of reality, of hope for a life worth living <br>
        Our pain ongoing on the daily <br>

        I was about to fall away, to let the memories fade <br>
        to disrupt no more thoughts of how and why and when and who, <br>

        counting life of each limb alike internal trunk of the tree of life <br>
        ellipsis outside ongoing ellipses. <br>
        <br>
        Remember too, your momentary fall as you tarry in the tree of life; <br>
        it is only when the tree of life is cut that each revolution is counted; <br>
        your fall will be neither judged nor tallied. <br>
        <br>
        And if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, <br>
        it will make a deafening sound and a weary wimper <br>

        you will howl and holler in flight or fight in freefall from the tree of life <br>
        and most definitely make your mark. <br>

        <br>
        I loved my troubled friend. <br>
        He went away from me, long before I left, <br>
        There's always more to say, <br>
        I remember us three running rings around my back garden fountain, naked <br>
        I remember his urging make-believe from a backyard tap, not water, but Coke, <br>
        I remember my first taste of Cola Cow; a concoction of Coca-Cola and Milk. <br>
        I remember our plans to somehow become rich and live in the same mansion, <br>
        I remember my neck ache after he pushed me from the roof of the shed, <br>
        I remember his amusement plain, of my pain across his face in a smile, <br>
        I remember the sting under my school shirt when he put a bee down my neck, <br>
        I remember his upbringing fraught, difficult, displacing torment onto, well, me. <br>
        I remember watching Robocop with him on Betamax, my first hyperviolent movie, <br>
        I remember violence, with and without him. <br>
        I remember his admiration I craved then, and now, in fleeting moments. <br>
        I remember the day we threw stones at a passing Bus Átha Cliath at 'the Hills' <br>
        I remember he ran to a mutual friend's house, whose father was a Garda... <br>
        I remember his mother, to a rightly-irate crowd of people, somehow, at my home <br>
        I remember, his mother shouting defiant -- 'my child is an angel!' -- <br>
        I remember my mother embarrassed, at our shite behaviour. <br>
        I remember our gang -- as we thought of ourselves -- less after that, <br>
        I remember I was forbidden to be friends, for fear of what I may become if I did. <br>
        I remember we had gone too far, further still to go, some further than others. <br>
        I remember the message clearly now, nearly a decade past; my eldest sister's friend. <br>
        I remember the sinking feeling as I read that she just thought she'd let me know -- <br>
        I remember the numbness, the disquiet and yet still the quiet in the room <br>
        I remember, he had killed himself,- <br>
        and now we'll never reminisce, reunite or face redress; <br>
        Harsher to his memory than he possibly deserves <br>
        There's always more to say, until we've had our say, or cannot say at all <br>
        The poem ends, <br>
        Soft as it began,- <br>
        I loved my troubled friend.

        I am jealous of the moments <br>
        That have never existed in my life <br>
        Rather than those I simply missed out on <br>
        Due to a lack of invite or involvement; <br>
        Mere FOMO doesn't raise my ire, <br>
        As much as I regret the moments not seized <br>
        Pleasures and pains from a lack of choices made <br>
        Chances lost to devastation of willpower <br>
        Of motivations lost to anxiety or fear <br>
        And I would rather memories lost to me <br>
        Of roads taken versus a lack thereof <br>
        The road most travelled is no path trod by me; <br>
        almost reclusive to all <br>
        My absences excused away, more's the pity <br>
        They say misery loves company <br>
        But there are few who suffer my presence <br>
        Too many suffering their own pretense <br>
        Inviting miserly truth of own aching hearts, forsooth <br>
        We all refuse the moments we covet <br>

      We curious humans have very recently detected <br>

      spread wide and far throughout the heavens <br>
      across all planets and a far flung future <br>
